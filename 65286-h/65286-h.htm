<h3><a name="Selection_of_a_Site_for_a_Park" id="Selection_of_a_Site_for_a_Park">Selection of a Site for a Park.</a></h3>

<p class="p3">BY H. W. S. CLEVELAND.</p>


<p>Few persons think of a park as anything
but a place of recreation, a pleasure ground,
and an ornamental appendage of a city.</p>

<p>As a consequence, if it is proposed to create
a park in any city, every suggestion that is
offered in regard to its location is based upon
the fact of its superior natural advantages; its
picturesque character; its command of fine
views, or the features of attractive interest it
combines.</p>

<p>Without denying the value of any of these
elements, I wish to call attention to other objects
which are rarely thought of, and yet are
deserving of careful consideration in determining
the location.</p>

<p>Almost every city comprises within its
limits some portion of territory which is not
adapted for business purposes, and is not attractive
to that class of inhabitants who can
afford to choose the location of their residences.
Such localities are at first left vacant,
but as population increases they are occupied
first by squatters, then by those who can afford
nothing better, and finally become the
site of tenement houses, or dens of resort for
the worst class of human beings, male and
female, that the city contains.</p>

<p>The original cause of the avoidance of the
place may have been that it was low and subject
to malarial influences, or of such topographical
character that it could only be
adapted to residence purposes at very great
cost.</p>

<p>In either of these cases it is obvious that the
first cost of the land will be far less than that
of a tract combining all the features which
render it most attractive as a site for residences.
Let us now consider some of the effects
of improving such sites:</p>

<p>Suppose the area to be low and wet, an unsightly
tract, suggestive of chills and fever,
and too extensive for improvement by its individual
owners. Instead of suffering it to
become the plague spot and breeding place
of moral and physical diseases, as it certainly
will if left to itself, let the city purchase and
improve it as a park, first, by thorough drainage,
and then by such artistic arrangement
as shall make it an attractive resort, and it is
obvious that the result will be not only the
securing of a charming place of recreation
and ornament to the city, but the conversion
of a threatening danger to health, into a chief
source of its promotion. The creation of
such an improvement also invariably changes
the character of its surroundings by rendering
them desirable as residence sites, and
thus repaying the cost by the increased taxable
value of adjacent property. It often happens,
however, that large areas are comprised
within, or adjacent to, a city, which even if
unobjectionable on the score of health are
not available for residence on account of their
topographical character.</p>

<p>The site of the New York Central Park affords
an illustration of my meaning:</p>

<p>At the time of its first inception in 1857&mdash;the
whole of that section of the city was a series
of barren ledges of rocks of such forbidding
nature that no individual proprietor could
afford the expense of preparing an area for
residence and providing himself with the
simplest necessities of comfort. The land
had only a nominal value, and its only occupants</p>

<h3><a name="Fresh_Meat_for_the_Farm" id="Fresh_Meat_for_the_Farm">Fresh Meat for the Farm.</a></h3>


<p>One of the greatest banes to the proper enjoyment
of country life is the almost constant
use of salt meats. It is ham for breakfast,
salty, oh, how salty! Then for dinner it
is salt pork, boiled or fried. Then for supper
a cold slice of ham, or boiled cold shoulder,
varied a little by chipped dried beef, which is
within itself a “piller of salt.” Then it is
drink, drink, from morning to night without
abatement.</p>

<p>Now, I know the great difficulties that lay
in the way of a farmer, located miles from
city or town, to procure a daily supply of
fresh meat from the markets, to say nothing
of the unbearable cost of such a proceeding
to those who live close enough to market to
procure a daily supply. Just think of it; we
sell our beef cattle to the butcher for, say
three cents on foot, and pay for the article on
the hook from twelve and a half to twenty
cents per pound, and our mutton and pork
in the same ratio. It is not my purpose, in
this article, to show the relative losses and
profits in these transactions, but to show my
brother farmers how they can have fresh
meat on their tables every day of the year,
and every meal of each day if they will, and
that at their own first cost prices. This plan
of mine is not new; yet, I am safe in saying
that it is not practiced by one per cent of the
farmers in the nation. Why is this? Ignorance
of the way to do it. It can be nothing
else. For there is less labor and work attending
the process of preserving the meats put
up for home consumption, by keeping them
fresh, than there is by salting, smoking, wrapping
in canvas, and packing away, as now
practiced. A second great advantage is, that
the curing of meats in a fresh state can be
accomplished at any season of the year, no
matter how hot, and that without ice.</p>

<p>Then, a third consideration is the saving of
labor to the farmer’s family during the hot
sweltering summer months, in fact, all
through the year.</p>

<p>To enable any person to understand the
matter, I will explain by briefly stating what
we are now doing in the way of preparing
our fresh meat for next summer’s use. In the
first place, we have as many lard or pork
barrels as will be necessary to hold a supply
of meat for the family. These barrels are
clean, sweet, and tight, one end taken out.
They are arranged on a bench in the cellar,
open end up. The pigs are killed and cooled
in the usual way. When the animal heat is
all out they are cut up, cutting off the sausage
and lard, the lard cut up ready to be rendered
out. The shoulders and sides are then
cut up into such sized pieces as may be convenient
for table use. These pieces are
washed cleanly, and boiled in large kettles,
seasoned with salt and pepper to make palatable,
and when sufficiently boiled for table
use they are placed in a barrel closely together,
but not pressed or mashed, thus leaving
each piece as near in the shape cut as
possible. When the barrel is filled within
two inches of the top, we then pour in warm
lard until all the crevices between the pieces
of meat are filled up, covering the top with
one or two inches of the warm lard. Next
day we find that the lard has settled down;
we fill up again to the top and keep filled until
all has become a solid mass of meat and
lard. This is the whole secret. You can fill
any tight vessel from a one gallon jar to a
forty-five gallon barrel in like manner, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
if properly done, and kept in a cool place the
meat will keep fresh and sweet the year
round.</p>

<p>The advantages of this process of keeping
meat are manifold. You can kill a fat hog
at any season of the year, and its own fat
can preserve it, and the fat can be used
for culinary purposes just the same as
when put up in cans for home use. The
shoulders can be thus prepared, and when
cold are far superior to salt meat, even after
being boiled. The sides when cut in square
pieces, with the ribs on, are just as good as
when cooked fresh in the fall of the year.
Hams, whole, when well cooked and seasoned,
retain all their sweetness, and that without
being impaired by the excess of salt necessary
to keep them. Then, there is no trouble with
flies, bugs, or skippers; the meat remains
sweet, wholesome, and palatable until the last
piece is taken from the bottom. All the care
necessary in taking the pieces from the barrel
is to press the lard down closely over
what is left, and thus exclude the air.</p>

<p>There are two great advantages in this
mode of keeping meat; one is, it is fresh,
easily digested, and consequently more
healthy, and decidedly more pleasant to the
taste; and it does not create that burning
thirst that is so hard to quench on a hot harvest
day. Then it is always ready for table
use, and that without requiring your wives,
daughters, and house help to melt over a hot
stove when the mercury is up among the
nineties, a no small saving in threshing time.</p>

<p>The only great drawback that I have found
to this plan is, that I can eat twice the amount
that I can of salted meats; and, therefore, it
requires double the quantity for family use
than under the salting process; but I am persuaded
that the difference is made up in better
health, and smaller doctor bills. Try it
on a small scale, and you will always follow
it.</p>

<p>I am now fifty-five years old and have always
lived in a good agricultural country.
Having had no rich friends to draw on for
supplies I have had to look to Mother Earth
for my living. Hence I feel that I should
pay homage to the Great Creator of all things
for that fair capacity which has enabled me
to select good lands and grow crops well
adapted to the soils.</p>

<p>While my work has been arduous in the
main, I have not felt it drudgery. In fact,
my farm has not only furnished me a good
living, but in its productions and developments
I have been highly entertained.</p>

<p>I am not different from most of my fellowmen.
I like to manage and dictate, and have
my own way. I manage so as to bring my
lands into subjection. I do it by making them
better. I cultivate and dress them until they
look better and feel better, and I know they
are better.</p>

<p>When I plant my crops I give them such
attention that it seems they have every confidence
that I will remove all obstructions
to hinder their growth, and the young and
tender plants seem to avail themselves of the
situation and spring up as by magic. In their
prosperity I rejoice.</p>

<p>I take a half dozen farm journals and a few
newspapers so as to learn what others are
doing without going from my home, especially
in the winter season. For I find that when
I go from home I can’t always get delicious
fruits and vegetables that I have learned to
be so fond of in my riper years.</p>

<p>Now I come to a point where I will venture
a proposition to my brother farmers:
That we organize a&mdash;well I don’t know just
what to name it, but say Farmers Communicative
Society. I mean by this that we select
some farm journal that seems most fitting
and send in our names and addresses, agreeing
to write once a month a short and candid
statement of our plans and successes and failures
in our agricultural and horticultural
pursuits. I am of course intending to get the
best of the bargain as I always try to do in
business. But it must be apparent to all that
we, as farmers, can be more benefited by
commingling our interests together in the
developments of the farm, and learn from
one another in a few years what it will take
each one of us a whole life time to learn
in case we continue to “go it alone” as in
olden times.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Editor, I think you can afford to
second the motion to help organize these practical
old farmers and get them to write for
your journal. I feel that we can give your
readers many practical ideas of benefit to all,
and you agree to clothe our crude thoughts
and make them appear intelligent before the
public, so that no one need be embarrassed to
“speak out in meetin’.”</p>

<p>Now the benefits to be derived from an association
to communicate through the paper
are to my mind much greater than from conventions.
All admit that farmers’ conventions
have accomplished great good in the
different interests, and that they are indispensable.
I am indebted to these conventions
for much of my success in farm life. But I
conclude that as great good, or even greater
good, can be accomplished at much less cost.
For a few hundred farmers can communicate
to each other through a good farm paper like
<span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span>, so paged that it can
be filed for future reference, and we can, as it
were, have our meetings every week at our
homes and with our families, and impress
the lessons upon our children’s tender minds
so they will not have to wait until they are
of mature age before hearing discussions
as to the best modes practiced in agriculture
and horticulture. I have felt in attending
these conventions like asking those old veterans
who must soon pass away, where are
the young men of our country? For very
few seem to attend these interesting gatherings.</p>

<p>Another reason why I suggest we adopt
<span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span> is, that <span class="smcap">The Prairie
Farmer company</span> sends to each of their
patrons a large map of the United States,
which would enable us to know the exact
locality of parties giving useful information,
which is always more satisfactory.</p>

<p>Now I am always trying new things and
looking after new industries, and I have made
a great many observations, some of which I
shall promise to give in farmers’ communications,
in case we can get a fair start so as to
get others to give me their observations, for
that is my prime object, as I stated in the
outset. I am like my Irish friend “I want a
little more than I give.” I am developing our
sweets in Kansas. I have also the finest
fruits of the land and succeeded in both, and
I will tell how I did it.</p>

<h3><a name="Botany_for_Farm_Boys" id="Botany_for_Farm_Boys">Botany for Farm Boys.</a></h3>


<p>This time I would like to call your attention
to the subject of botany. It might seem
rather odd at this time of year, but you know
that the farmers have more time now than in
summer to read <span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span>. It
is better for the farmer’s boys to become acquainted
with the laws of nature than to
spend their time in reading novels, or other
books, which bring them little information.
A little knowledge of the nature of plants is
worth infinitely more to the farmer’s son or
daughter, or even to the farmer himself, because
it has special relation to his calling.
And in order to obtain a practical knowledge
it is best to study the plants themselves, their
structure, their habitat and peculiarity of
growth, etc., and in order to do so, it is best
to have some apparatus for the purpose, requisite
for the accomplishment of this object.</p>

<p>The student in botanical science should
give early and persevering attention to the
collection and preservation of specimens of
as many species of plants as he can procure.
The advantages to be derived from such collections,
either in refreshing the memory by
reviewing them, or in instituting a more
thorough examination at one’s leisure, are
such as will afford an abundant compensation
for all the labor requisite in preparing them.
Such a collection of dried specimens of plants
is called an herbarium, or by the more significant
title, hortus siccus (dry garden).</p>

<p>The apparatus requisite for the accomplishment
of this object is, first, a close tin box,
twenty inches in length, and of a portable
form; second, a portable press, consisting of
two boards of light material, twelve by eighteen
inches, opening and shutting by hinges,
like the cover of a book, and secured by
springs (even a large book is a good substitute);
third, a quantity of smooth, bibulous
paper, of large size (a dozen or more quires of
printing paper); fourth, eight or ten boards of
the same size as the paper; fifth, a small screw
press, or several lead weights of various sizes,
from fifteen to thirty pounds each.</p>

<p>In gathering plants for this purpose, or
specimens, as they are called, the smaller and
herbaceous plants should be taken up with a
portion of the roots, while from larger plants
there should be selected a shoot, with complete
representations of the leaves and flowers.
They may be preserved for several days,
without withering, in the tin box, or they
may at once be laid between several thicknesses
of the paper and inclosed in the portable
press. It is always desirable that they be
gathered on a dry day; if not they should be
freed from dampness before being committed
to the paper and press.</p>

<p>In drying the specimens, great care is required,
that they may preserve well their
natural appearance, form, and color. It is
generally recommended that they be carefully
spread out, as nearly in their natural
position as possible, between eight or ten
thicknesses of paper, and then submitted to
pressure between the boards. The degree of
pressure should never be such as to crush
their parts, and may be easily regulated by
the screw, or by the number and size of the
weights used. Cotton-batting may be used to
equalize the pressure.</p>

<p>As often as once a day they should be taken
from the press, transferred to fresh and dry
paper, and returned, until they are thoroughly
dried, when they are ready to be transferred
to the cabinet. The true secret of preserving
specimens with all their colors is to extract
the moisture from them by pressure in an
abundance of dry, bibulous paper as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>The next object with the collector is the
arrangement of his specimens. For this purpose
each one is first to be fastened to a sheet
of firm white paper, about ten by eighteen
inches, either by glue or with loops of paper
of the same kind, or they may be stitched
to the paper with a fine needle. The latter
mode, if done skillfully, is preferable. Then
let all those specimens which belong to the
same genus be collected together and placed
within a folded sheet of colored paper, with
the name of the genus and each species written
on the outside. Each sheet should also
be labeled with the names of the plants, the
locality, time of gathering, habits, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The genera are next to be collected together
into orders, each order being wrapped or
folded in a still larger sheet, of a different
color from that which enfolds the genera,
having the name of the order with a catalogue
of its genera on the outside. Thus arranged,
the orders are to be laid away upon the
shelves of a cabinet, or packed in a chest. To
protect the plants from the attack of insects
pieces of camphor gum are to be laid among
them, or a piece of sponge saturated with the
oil of turpentine. To save them from decay
they should be kept dry and well ventilated.</p>

<p>Fruits and seeds which are too large to be
pressed with the plants, and also truncheons
of wood, are to be pressed separately in a cabinet.
In the above I have closely followed
the directions of Professor Wood in his excellent
work on Botany, which would prove a
profitable pastime for those desiring to improve
their knowledge in this direction.</p>

<h3><a name="Diogenes_in_His_Tub" id="Diogenes_in_His_Tub">Diogenes in His Tub.</a></h3>


<p>Diogenes in this desires to call the attention
of all readers of <span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span>
to what he deems a very important subject
and a great wrong&mdash;one to which they have
heretofore seemed strangely indifferent.</p>

<p>The papers teem of late years with accounts
of sharks passing about among farmers
and others, and under various pretences,
obtaining their signatures to documents, innocent
in themselves&mdash;but which eventually
turn up as notes of hand in possession of
third persons. And the result (it is always
so stated) is, that the note is collectable and
has to be paid.</p>

<p>And the papers with one voice unite in
warning their readers against using their
signature in such a way.</p>

<p>Now, Messrs. Editors, and fellow readers,
is it possible that there is such a principle
in our laws&mdash;common or statute&mdash;that makes
such a thing possible; that legalizes such a
fraud? If so, it is not only unsafe for a man
to sign a contract of any sort, but to write a
letter to a friend. And while I am loth to
believe there is any statute justifying it, I
feel sure there is no common law principle
that will sustain it; or if there is, it is a relic
of barbarism that common sense and common
justice ought long since to have swept into
oblivion.</p>

<p>The theory seems to be acquiesced in on the
ground that innocent parties must not be
made to suffer. But this theory will not hold
good. Thousands of cases occur in which
innocent persons do, and are compelled by
law and by right as well, to suffer loss from
just such frauds. A rogue may steal or borrow
my horse and sell him to a neighbor,
who buys in good faith. The law, and right
and justice, instead of compelling me to lose
my animal, permits me to replevy him and
take him home, and my neighbor pockets his
loss. And this is done daily over the land
without objection; and we hear no newspaper
cautions to the “gullible” farmers not to
lend horses. So with every other species of
property; one can take his own legally wherever
he may find it&mdash;in the hands of a rogue
or of an innocent purchaser.</p>

<p>It is strange to me that this thing has been
permitted to go on so long unchallenged. I
do not know whether the courts have ever
sustained such a principle; if they have, unless
there be much more cogent reason for it
than I can conceive of, the sooner it is reversed
the better for honest men and good
government. Will you allow me, through
your widely read pages, to earnestly call the
attention of your readers to the subject matter&mdash;and
not only your readers, but your cotemporaries
of the agricultural press as well.
Let the principle be ventilated.</p>

<h3><a name="How_He_Likes_Dakota" id="How_He_Likes_Dakota">How He Likes Dakota.</a></h3>


<p>In passing through Chicago last spring on
my way to Dakota, I called at your office and
paid for <span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span>. The gentleman
in the office requested me to write you
about Dakota. I have delayed doing so until
now to learn about the winters here, and as it
is now on hand, I write.</p>

<p>The last half of December and the first half
of January we had the cold wave, the mercury
going below zero from 8 to 40 deg. We
have from six to seven inches of snow on the
level. Thermometer now ranging from 10
below to 20 above. We have had some windy
days that make the snow fly. I was in Illinois
before leaving for Dakota some forty-five
years, and I did not in all that time see a
more pleasant winter; but a very few days
that a man could not be at work if he choose.
The wind is no harder nor more frequent
than in Illinois&mdash;just the same as near as
could be made. Now for the land, etc.:</p>

<p>Here in Brown county, about twelve to
fifteen miles from the 46 parallel (south) the
land is nicely rolling, just about as any one
would wish. There is very little choice in
location, only as distance from railway stations.
The soil is black sandy loam, good
for small grain, and, judging from experiment
in sod corn, we can raise corn and a
good crop mature if put in in good season,
and of an early variety.</p>

<p>I never say anything against Illinois. It is
good enough, and Dakota is just as good, and
in one-quarter of the time that Illinois was
in developing, Dakota will be up even with
her, the facilities being far in advance of
those of early Illinois. Then we had to team
all of our wheat into Chicago by wagon for
nearly twenty years before we had a canal or
railroad. But here we have the railroads to
start with, and if emigration is as large next
spring as it was the last there will not be a
foot of land to be located. There is not a
quarter section left now in Brown county,
unless it has been overlooked. Towns are
growing up as fast as toad-stools in summer.
We are located six miles from Frederick (600
inhabitants), seven miles from West Port (200),
ten miles from Ordway (500), twenty miles
from Aberdeen (2,000), twenty from Columbia
(1,000), county seat. The land is watered
about the same as Illinois, with the elm and
maple along the Jim river. For wells we dig
from twenty-five to forty feet and get the best
of water.</p>

<p>I think Dakota as good a place for a young
man of small means as can be found. There
are some counties where the land has not
been surveyed yet, where good location may
be made. Our crops were short last year in
Brown county, caused by a short time of dry
weather in June, just as the wheat and oats
were in blossom, at which time these crops
require rain in order to “fill” well.</p>

<p>The only drawback we have is in the matter
of fuel as yet. Soft coal sells at from $7 to
$8 per ton: hard, $12 to $13. Dry-goods and
groceries are as low as in Illinois. Lumber
from $2 to $4 higher. Our vegetables can not
be beaten.</p>

<p>Just a thing or two more. I want to ask
you what are the best kinds of timber for us
to put out on our tree claims. Will the black
walnuts, black and white oaks do well as far
north as we are? How will the Scotch and
Norway pines do? I wish to put out such
timber as will make good lumber when
grown. Cotton wood, box elder, etc., will just
answer the law, that is about all.</p>

<h3><a name="Woven_Paling_Fence" id="Woven_Paling_Fence">Woven Paling Fence.</a></h3>


<p>A Washington firm of patent solicitors
write us, as we suppose they have all the agricultural
papers, warning readers against
persons claiming of them a fee of $500 and
upwards for alleged infringements of a patent
upon a so-called “Wire and Picket Fence.”
Our informants say that, “It is quite true that
there are a number of patents for wire and
picket fences, or so-called ‘woven paling
fences,’ but all these patents are limited in
their claims to the detailed construction of
the woven fence, and there is no broad patent
on this class of fence. Indeed it was invented
as long ago as 1829, when Chauncy Hall, of
Meriden, Ct., on November 27th, of that year,
obtained the first patent for a wire and
paling fence. All recent applications for patents
which have endeavored to claim the
woven fence broadly have been rejected,
as we find by an examination of the records
of the United States Patent Office, on the old
patent to James Moore, of Pittsburg, Pa., for
a woven picket fence, which was granted
June 30, 1857, and therefore, expired in 1871,
so that it is now public property. There is
another patent of the same year granted to J. B.
Reyman, of Bloomington, Ill., No. 18,301,
dated September 29, 1857, which, also, shows
a paling and wire fence, or picket and wire
fence. This patent has, also, been frequently
cited as a reference against applications of
subsequent patentees who endeavor to claim
broadly the invention of the combined wire
and picket fence. In 1849, one, Lucius Leavenworth,
obtained a patent for a method of
constructing a fence by fastening pickets or
palings upon the wires by means of a series
of links formed on the connecting wires and
adapted to receive or hold the pickets or palings.
All of these patents have long ago expired,
and are now public property, so that
no person can claim to have a broad patent
on the, so-called, woven picket fence, and any
man who, by virtue of a pretended claim
covering broadly that class of fences, asserts
such a right may be put down as an impostor,
and should receive treatment as such.
Of late years a number of patents have been
granted for this class of fences, but, as soon
stated, the claims of all these patents are confined
to the detailed construction of the fence,
i. e., the precise weaving of the pickets between
the wires. A number of machines
have, also, been patented for constructing
this kind of fence, one of the first being that
which was patented by Fletcher on Nov. 17,
1868.”</p>

<p>We have heard of no trouble from these
patent agents in the West, but give our readers
for what it is worth the information
vouchsafed by the Washington firm.</p>

plan of keeping a force of four or five men at
work on highways through most of the year
under the supervision of an experienced and
skillful builder of roads, who gives his attention
constantly to the work. Every part of
the seventy-five miles of highway in the town
is in good condition, and the expense of keeping
it so has been much less than it could
have been by the old method. The new plan
has greatly relieved the farmers, who have
not been called to work on the roads at a time
when other duties demanded their attention.
New York has a law which directs that the
voters of any town may elect to adopt this
plan of hiring a force of men and a competent
commissioner to make and keep in repair
the roads of their town, but the plan,
once adopted, must be followed for not less
than three years. It has been found that by
the method described the roads have been
kept in better condition than ever before, and
that the cost of the work has actually been
less than that of road-making by the old
way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Correspondent Ohio Farmer</span>: In 1882
I raised a piece of Hubbard squashes. The
ground was manured very heavily with rich
rotten compost, probably at the rate of fifty
tons or more per acre. It is necessary to
make the land very rich to succeed with this
crop, but that isn’t the point I am after. That
same land last year was planted with potatoes,
and it was there that they rolled out so
large and numerous as to yield at the rate of
500 bushels per acre. Just over the fence, on
a part of another lot, where no manure had
been applied for many years, there were only
200 bushels per acre. Difference in soil and
kinds of potatoes might account for some of
this great variation in yield, but I think it
fair to say that 200 bushels per acre of the
best yield was owing to the manure put on
the ground for squashes the previous year.
The potatoes were none of them sold for less
than forty cents a bushel, so we have at least
$80 per acre cash benefit from that heavy
manuring the second year, to say nothing of
$240 an acre which the squashes brought. It
was, of course, a little more trouble to pick up
and market the larger crop, but enough of the
potatoes were sold for over forty cents per
bushel to pay for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> at Elgin last week we accompanied
Dr. Pratt to his home to take a look at his
herd of Holstein cattle. The sight of the
long rows of stalls filled with this young
breeding milk stock was a surprise. Counting
a new arrival of twenty-five during our
visit the Doctor now has about 130 head&mdash;certainly
one of the largest as it is one of the
best herds of Holsteins in the country. The
Doctor breeds and buys to sell again, and his
trade is large, as he does not demand fancy
prices but simply a fair return for his investment,
care and labor. The famous bull Cyclone
heads the home herd. The females are
generally from a year and a half to three
years old. Duchess of York is his brag cow,
though he has other strains nearly as famous
for milk. The young bull, Berkhout, a
prize winner in Holland, is a capital animal.
Though a dull season of the year shipments
from this herd are numerous. A bull and
three heifers go the present week to J. J.
Conklin, Valley Creek, Texas. H. H. Bissell,
Navasota, Texas, takes a bull and two females.
The promising bull Duke, of Oak
Hill, goes to A. H. Woodruff, Lansing, Iowa.
Mr. W. also takes a yearling heifer. The Duke
weighs 1,650 pounds, and was but two years
old the 17th of June last. The Doctor reports
the demand from the South as wonderfully
increasing. In 1883 he had orders from
Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, Kentucky
and Tennessee. He will stock his
ranch in Kansas this spring and summer
with a view to supplying the West and Southwest
with grades and full bloods.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="A_Scare_in_Missouri" id="A_Scare_in_Missouri">A Scare in Missouri.</a></h3>


<p>Information was received at the Department
of Agriculture, at Washington, last
week that a new and heretofore unknown
cattle disease has broken out in various parts
of Missouri. It was reported most prevalent
in the vicinity of Mexico.</p>

<p>As is usual in such matters when first
brought to public notice the facts have been
greatly exaggerated. Dr. Salmon, Chief of
the Government Veterinary Bureau, who
was in Chicago this week, says that as presented
to him at Washington he did not consider
the outbreak a very serious one. The
trouble so far as he knows exists in but a single
herd, and that near Mexico. He promptly
sent a veterinarian to the spot to investigate
and report. He judges from the information
he has received that the disease is simply the
impaction of food in the stomach, something
far from uncommon at this season of the
year. It results generally from eating the
dried fodder of the corn-fields. It is in no
sense contagious.</p>

<p>Perhaps our veterinary editor will give us
something regarding the treatment of this
trouble. In the meantime we give a remedy
suggested by a Missouri gentleman who
called at this office last week: Keep in a
trough before the cattle at all times, a mixture
of slaked lime and salt, and let them have
free access to good water.</p>

<h3><a name="Remedy_for_Foot-and-Mouth_Disease" id="Remedy_for_Foot-and-Mouth_Disease">Remedy for Foot-and-Mouth Disease.</a></h3>


<p>Rev. F. H. Brett, Carsington Rectory, writes
as follows to the English agricultural papers:</p>

<p>Some few years ago, when the foot-and-mouth
disease was prevailing, I gave a farmer
in this parish, who had the disease among
his cattle, some sulphur<i>ous</i> acid, and advised
him to make trial of the following treatment:
To put about two ounces of the acid into a
quart bottle and fill up with water, and then
give about a tablespoonful of this dilution
three times a day to the diseased cattle. He
acted upon my advice, and the result was
that his cattle were quickly cured of the disease.
Again, two or three weeks ago one of
my parishioners came to me to inform me
that one of his cows was affected with this
disease, and to ask me if I could give him
anything for it. I gave him some of the same
acid, to be used as above stated, and advised
him also to burn a little sulphur in the shed
in which the diseased cow was kept, two or
three times a day. He followed my advice,
and three or four days after I was informed
that the cow was doing nicely, and was giving
her milk again. My confidence in the
remedy is therefore confirmed, and I think I
am in duty bound to make it as widely known
as possible. In addition to giving the acid
internally, I advised the moistening of the
affected feet also with the same dilution with
a sponge.</p>

<p>The sulphur<i>ous</i> acid acts remedially, I conclude,
by being destructive of the life of the
microbes, or exceedingly minute animaculæ,
that gives rise to the disease; and I feel persuaded
that, if the owners of cattle would
take the trouble to burn a little sulphur once
or twice a week in their cattle sheds, they
would not only protect their cattle from attacks
of foot-and-mouth disease, but have
them also in a more healthy and vigorous
condition, especially in the season of tying-up
and confinement.</p>

<p>I have underlined the last syllable of sulphurous
to guard against mistake. Sulphur<i>ic</i>
acid would only be productive of mischief.
Sulphur<i>ous</i> acid may be obtained through
any druggist in sealed stoppered bottles at a
small expense.</p>

<p>The simplest way of burning sulphur in
the cowsheds is as follows: Take a slip of
cardboard, or of extra stout brown paper,
about a foot long and two inches wide, and
place on one extremity about as much coarsely-powdered
brimstone as would lie on a penny
piece, hold it by the other end, and apply
the flame of a candle till the sulphur is ignited,
and then wave it about in the shed, in
order to disperse the vapor among the cattle;
if there be straw, or anything else inflammable
about, hold a tile, or something of the sort,
in the other hand, under the burning sulphur,
to catch any that may drop.</p>

<h3>The Wisconsin Dairymen.</h3>


<p>The papers and discussions at Lake Mills
comprehended quite a range of topics,
and they were handled with marked ability.
Three of the essays have now appeared in
<span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span> in full. They were
too good to slaughter by abridgment, and the
same remark applies to other papers, yet our
space is too limited for an unabridged report.</p>


<h4>THE ROAD TO THE FACTORY,</h4>

<p>by Robt. Fargo, showed the people how
much they are losing by persisting in having
poor roads, when by a small expense they
might have good ones. The road tax is improperly
applied. He thought that a good
gravel road in most localities could be made
for $1,000 per mile, the road-bed to be graveled
one foot deep and twelve feet wide.</p>


<h4>CANADA VS. WISCONSIN.</h4>

<p>Mr. Harris’ paper, printed in last week’s
<span class="smcap">Farmer</span>, elicited considerable discussion.
Members desired to know if, in the essayist’s
opinion, Canadian dairy management was superior
to that of the States, and especially of
Wisconsin. The reply was in the affirmative.
There seems to be more thoroughness on the
part of Canadian dairymen. They have no
better grass, nor water, nor cows. They discriminate
more rigidly between good and bad
patrons. They sometimes bring the law to
bear against those who water milk or skim it.
The factories there are mostly owned by
stock companies. When tainted milk is discovered
in the vat, it is traced back as soon as
possible to its source, and the patron bringing
it is excluded. The law there is similar to
that in New York and was founded upon
that law. Mr. Fish related an instance where
a fraudulent patron in Herkimer county, N. Y.,
had been detected, sued, and heavily fined
for his practices. Mr. Harris said as inspector
of factories, he always refused to receive
milk from cows allowed to feed on slough
grass or drink stagnant water. Such milk
would always prevent the manufacture of
good cheese. He wants no milk from cows
forced to feed on marshes. When a man applies
to a factory to sell his milk, he looks the
man over, he visits his farm, he looks at the
stables and all the surroundings, and he can
generally tell whether or not it is safe to receive
that man’s milk.</p>


<h4>COMPETITION.</h4>

<p>It cropped out in this discussion that in
some parts of Wisconsin and Illinois there
are too many factories. Competition leads
factorymen to often receive milk that should
be discarded. To offend a man by enforcing
strict cleanliness, non-skimming, and stripping
was to drive him to a neighboring factory
and his custom is lost. It is hard to make
owners of cows honest when dishonest or
selfish factorymen encourage them in selfish
and fraudulent ways. Mr. Harris said at
some of the best Canadian factories patrons
were refused the privilege of taking home the
whey in their milk cans. He would have no
objection to their taking the whey if all
would cleanse their cans properly. But this
could not be depended upon.</p>


<h4>WATER IN MILK.</h4>

<p>He detects water in milk by means of a
little German instrument called Horren’s
Milk Tester, patented in Hanover. They
cost fifty cents each by the 100. They are for
sale by Cornish &amp; Curtis, Ft. Atkinson, Wis.,
and by some others of the dairy supply concerns.
This little instrument is invaluable to
the factoryman.</p>


<h4>PRIDE IN BUSINESS.</h4>

<p>Another thing about the Canadians is they
take such pride in their business that they
are not given to adulterating their butter and
cheese. They make a cheese that sells as the
best cheddar in the English markets. The
best Wisconsin cheese that Mr. Harris saw
at the Milwaukee dairy fair was several
points below the best Canadian article. The
difference lies in the want of skill in the
maker, and the greed of the patrons which
often leads them to skim and to withhold the
strippings.</p>


<h4>SKIMMING.</h4>

<p>There were those present who claimed that
more money can be realized by making both
butter and cheese than from cheese alone,
though its quality makes it bring a higher
price. So long as this is the case such will
continue to make skim cheese. They say a
man must be governed by the market he is to
supply. If one makes for a home market
where skim cheese is liked it is all right to
make butter from the same milk. It was replied
that as our dairymen in general must
look abroad for their market, that good,
straight, full cream cheese is bound to win in
the long run. When the foreign market for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
the Wisconsin product is destroyed it will
take years of honest effort to rebuild the old
reputation.</p>


<h4>THE CHEDDAR.</h4>

<p>The cheddar cheese of Canada is made by
drawing off the whey while it is sweet, the
curd being allowed to sour afterward. It
takes too long to make this cheese to suit the
Western cheese-maker. But you can not
make the best cheese in a hurry. There is
more nutriment in the cheddar than in the
common cheese of the States.</p>


<h4 class="x-ebookmaker-important">BY THE ACRE.</h4>

<p>Mr. Hiram Smith said in his paper that he
computes his butter and cheese by the acre,
meaning that his effort is to see how much
dairy product he can get from an acre of
ground. The herd of cows that can produce
the most from a mow of hay or a given
amount of pasturage is the best herd. That
system which will take 1,000 lbs. of feed and
get the most from it is the best system. He
plows up about four acres of pasture every
year, and proposes to reduce the acreage of
his pasture thus gradually to the end. He
grows feed for the cows on the acres plowed
up. It is the cheapest method. He uses
green feed, bran, straw, roots, etc. This gives
the most milk at the least expense. He uses
the submerging system of butter-making.
A bushel basket full of pounded ice twice per
day will keep milk cool regardless of weather.
Cool the milk suddenly no matter what
the system. Four pounds of butter from 100
pounds of milk is all he expects to get in
summer. In fall, perhaps another pound, but
it will not be of so high a grade.</p>


<h4>THE HOLSTEINS.</h4>

<p>Mr. Curtis, of New York, said a good word
for the Holsteins as dairy stock. At the
Cornell University farm they come in at two
years, are milked seven or eight years, and
then fattened for beef. He would not recommend
this system for all breeds.</p>


<h4>CALVES.</h4>

<p>Mr. Northup said he can raise better
calves on skimmed milk than on whole milk.
Others agreed with him, and a few differed,
asking what the Lord put the cream in milk
for. Reply: to mix with butterine.</p>


<h4>ITEMS.</h4>

<p>Professor Henry mentioned some of the
experiments now being carried on at the
State University to show the value of different
stock foods, tile, drainage, etc. He is
feeding cotton seed meal, malt, sprouts, oil
cake, ensilage, etc. Cotton seed meal induces
a very rich flow of milk.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith thinks skimmed milk worth
35 cents per 100 pounds for cheese-making,
for those who have a demand for that kind of
cheese.</p>

<p>Mr. Favill, of Walworth county, set the
teeth of the dairymen on edge, by asserting
and proving by figures that he could make
more money from same outlay in beef making
in six months, than any of them could in a
year from the dairy. Mr. F. will write out
his experience in this line for <span class="smcap">The Prairie
Farmer</span> at an early day.</p>

<p>We cut short our notes of the discussions
somewhat, to make room for Mr. Smith’s instructive
essay on</p>


<h4>NEGLECTED OPPORTUNITIES.</h4>

<p>So long as it is true that the average yield,
per cow, in milk that is taken to the factories
is less rather than more than 3,000 pounds per
season, and so long as it is true that there are
dairymen whose cows yield from 4,000 to 5,000
pounds each per season, it will be easy to
make it appear there are neglected opportunities
on the part of most dairymen which, if
availed of, would greatly augment the annual
yield, and consequently make larger the
profits.</p>

<p>One of the fundamental truths in stock-raising,
and in profitable milk production, is, that
it takes a given amount of food to support the
animal’s existence in such a way that it will
simply maintain its status; and that growth
in flesh or yield in milk, above an evenly balanced
existence, must come from the food
given to cause an increase of weight in flesh,
fat, or milk products. Hence, all the profit
must come from that excess, and is large or
small just in proportion as the animal is capacitated
to utilize and digest it, within the
bounds of healthy, judicious feeding. So that
farmer was sound who, when he fed up to
the very verge of that limit, and was told by
a skeptic that he did not believe high feeding
paid, replied he was only sorry that his cows
could not healthfully digest more. The capital
invested in the cows, in the soil, in the
barns and stables, in the care and time devoted
to milking and waiting on them, is very
nearly the same, whether they produce 3,000
pounds each per season, or 5,000 pounds. At
first it may be granted that if a farm is stocked
to its capacity in feeding a herd of 3,000-pound
cows, that some outside food must be
imported from other soil to enable the same
herd to yield 5,000 pounds each. But the enriching
of the manure through high feeding,
and the consequent enriching of the land,
will soon obviate the necessity of the importation
of outside food. If this is not true, I
admit that my opinion is based on false premises;
and that the opponents of high feeding
have the best of the argument, as well as a
majority of the disciples, and a majority of
the thinly-covered bones of the so-called dairy
stock of the State. In support of the idea
that there is an added value to the manure
through high feeding, it may be stated that
there are many places in the Eastern States
in which in estimating the earnings of the
cow each year, that the milk, or butter and
cheese, the calf and the pork are not only
counted, but $10 per well-fed cow is added
for the increased value she has put upon the
soil, deposited it in a bank that never breaks.
What is true of the old East is fast becoming
true of the soil of the older settled portions
of Wisconsin. To augment the productive
capacity of a given number of acres, that will
now support in semi-starvation a given number
of cows, to a point in fertility that will add
2,000 pounds of milk per annum to each cow,
milk worth, say $20, is to have the funds in
hand to pay the sum of $400 as interest on the
added value to an ordinary farm of eighty
acres that is made to well keep twenty cows,
instead of keeping them in the usual way.
Four hundred dollars will pay 5 per cent interest
per annum on an added value of $100
per acre to the farm. This can be done without
adding a cow to the herd. All done by a
simple expansion, through better use of the
capital already in the hands of many who
work on the semi-starvation plan.</p>

<p>The very first neglected opportunity of the
mass of farmers is, that they do not see, and
do not make much effort to see, that there is
a better way than to plow, and plow, and
plow, seldom seed down, keep a few head of
spindling cows, mostly to give birth to spindling
calves, that by a stretch of the imagination
may be called cows when five or six
years old; sell such cows, instead of selling
butter and cheese to buy their clothes and
groceries, sell hay to buy their whisky, and
their farms by the bushel to pay for them if in
debt, or to add some improvements in buildings
if they are not. It would be useless to
further describe them&mdash;they are not here, as
they never go to dairy conventions, or even
to county agricultural meetings or annual
fairs; and so any rebuke of their methods
would not reach their ears. Let them pass;
the chief regret for their fate being that their
name is legion, and that they seem to be beyond
the reach of mercy.</p>

<p>The next class, and the one for which this
association has much missionary work to do,
is the one that has shown some signs of progress;
that is still in unbelief of the radical
truth, but yet seems to be uttering the invocation
of doubting Thomas, of old. The most
marked neglect of opportunity by this class
is in not accepting the truth alluded to previously,
that it pays to transform 2,500 and
3,000-pound cows into 4,000 and 5,000-pound
ones, through the process of more generous,
and better paying feeding. Many of this
class know that a paying flow of milk comes
only from food judiciously given; but who
have not yet learned the programme by which
such food can be ever on hand, or do not possess
the intelligent enterprise to put forth the
means to obtain it. As this is, largely, the
hopeful class, we may well pray for their
growth in dairy grace, in the knowledge of
the truth, as it is exemplified in the reliable
experience of the few saints in the business,
who know how to make good common cows
earn $50 and $60, and more, each, per annum.</p>

<p>Observation and my factory books for a
series of years, teach that persons of this class
start out well in the spring, and have cows that
maintain the flowing stream for awhile, so
that the four-and-five-thousand pound yield
would be obtained if they did not suffer it to
come to grief, by not providing means to
hedge against the immediate and consequent
influences of the first serious check in the
supply of palatable and easily digested food
in the pastures. This is the great fatality of
the whole business&mdash;a tolerated calamity as
we may call it, for it endures a lapse that
can not afterward be made good, the same
season. It is to the paying yield of the cow
what an untimely frost is to an unmatured
corn crop. It is my firm belief that this is the
great sin of the medium good dairyman of
this and other dairy States,&mdash;the cause of the
low average earnings of the cows; the reason
why so many dairymen work so cheaply; the
promoter of infidelity in the mind of the
dairyman as to whether he has not made a
mistake in entering upon the dairy business
at all; in short, it is the chief “neglected opportunity”
to get upon the highway to success.
That opportunity, when interpreted,
means that when the chief available supply
of food fails, or lessens, or becomes unpalatable
or undigestible, that a substitute previously
provided should be immediately supplied.
Let the substitute be early rye, clover, oats,
millet, corn, or other fodder, grown for the
purpose, according to the time in the season
in which the pressing need comes; and if
neither are in available time, then let the
substitute take the form of ground grain in
larger measures than should be given to every
cow in milk, every day, even when feeding
on the flushest and choicest of grasses. That
is the way the 5,000-pound to the cow dairymen
do; and they win in doing it. But the
blighted class seem to look upon it as they
would on an accidental fire, an untimely
death, an early frost, an unavertable calamity;
a kind of Providential dispensation, the
superstitious regard it. The latter class betake
themselves to prayer for rain, instead of taking
the scoop-shovel to the provender, and
distributing it to their famishing herds.
Troops of them don’t know that they are suffering
any but present loss in weight, and delude
themselves into thinking a blessed rain
will restore their cows to the position they
fell from. They don’t seem to comprehend
that they thus lose their grip on the $50 and
$60 per annum prize, and their uncertainty
of getting it. The result is, they have their
big flow of milk at the season of the year in
which dairy products are ever the cheapest;
and their cows are crippled for good performance
at the pail, when ever-returning good
prices in the fall and early winter show them
what golden opportunities they have lost.</p>

<p>Now I can look over my list of patrons and
see in my mind’s eye the men who practice
both the systems I allude to. One is the discomforted,
doubting dairyman with but too
little to show for his hard work; and the
other has a good bank account, or a plethoric
purse, and his sharpest look is given in search
of more good cows, whose owners don’t know
any more than to sell them. There is not a
whine about them, nor do they go into a decline
because another half-cent could not be
squeezed out of the cheese market. Their talk
is, content with “well done,” and their
cure for hard times is, “more milk.”</p>

<p>The most manifest loss, as it appears to one
taking note of merely dollars and cents, in
the prosecution of any special pursuit comes
to light in the dairy business, from this the
chief neglected opportunity of the dairymen
to gain more wealth.</p>

<p>There are other neglected opportunities,&mdash;minor
matters in themselves&mdash;that if improved
would make the goal of the enterprising
dairymen easier of attainment, and are, therefore,
desirable adjuncts in accomplishing his
purposes, and they seem to be concomitants
of measurably high success. One is in not
properly testing the real profit-earning capacity
of each cow, and weeding out those
that are not only not profitable but are actually,
year after year, eating into the profits derived
from other, and it may be not so good
appearing cows. Profitable performance not
only at the pail, but at the churn and the
cheese-vat, should alone give a cow respite
from coming, in her youth, to the butcher’s
block.</p>

<p>Another, is that there is a woeful benightedness
in providing stables suitable to milk
in, and easy and healthful for the cows to
live in, as they should be allowed to do for
more than half of the hours of the year. The
advanced dairymen who have plank floors
daily littered, cleaned, and cleansed, drops in
the floor, and clean walks in the rear of the
cows, well-ventilated, but warm, non-freezing
stables, would be amazed and disgusted to enter
what I greatly fear are a majority of the
stables of the State, in which the cows are
thrust to endure a painful and filthy existence.
When purity of product has a great influence
in gauging the price, and the health
of consumers is at stake, this neglect in providing
better and more cleanly stabling is
one of the crying ills of our dairy system. I
am glad to know that the supervision of the
health officials of Milwaukee extends to the
stables of the cows that produce the milk
that is allowed to be sold in that city. It
would be well if it was made the imperative
duty of the health officials of every town to
forcibly establish the blessings of a decent
civilization in the cow stables of more than
half of the farmers of Wisconsin. I am moved
to thus speak because of what I have seen&mdash;and
smelled. I will not quarrel with a man
who claims the unalienable right to rot, as a
hermit, but I deny his right to freely make
and sell to others, unwholesome food, into
which he has mingled filth and the germs of
disease and death. It is shameful to neglect
to provide good and healthful stables for food-producing
dairy stock&mdash;one that calls for
vengeance on a criminality.</p>

<p>Another neglected opportunity of the dairymen
to increase the number of head their
farms might subsist, and thus increase their
profits, especially those who occupy our highest
priced lands, is in their declining to adopt
the system of soiling. I do not know of a
highly successful dairyman in the State who
has not adopted it, in part, at least&mdash;enough
to save his cows when famine is in sight.
Neither do I believe there is one who would
not be more successful if he should practice
it more. The arrived-at goal of the select few
who keep as many cows as they have acres
of land, has been reached by and through the
soiling process; and approximate successes
like theirs must be achieved by traveling the
same route. There are those who are ensmalling
their pastures, and at the same time,
increasing their herds, because the lands taken
from the pasture and devoted to soiling
crops produce more than the old herds can
consume. The wandering cow feeds herself,
in fact, from what might be the choicest
product of her own milk, tramps the life out
of much more, and tosses her head in disdain
at much that if cut and properly fed in the
stall, she would eat with a relish; so that it
may be safely said that two, and some practical
men say three, cows might be well-fed
through soiling, on the same land that one is
by the system of exclusive pasturing.</p>

<p>Another, it may well be called the lost opportunity&mdash;that
grows out of the neglected
ones alluded to, is that the cows are not kept
in good milking condition more of the time of
the year. The men who seize and utilize the
few opportunities I have mentioned very
soon learn that they have an almost perpetual
fount of wealth; and that they can
not afford to dry it up, and wait for spring.
Putting in more time for the cow to produce,
inevitably convinces them of the fact that the
larger part of the cow’s earnings are made
when dairy products are high in price; and
they are dull, indeed, if they do not see in
that a revelation that more winter dairying
would pay. I am aware that the flippant answer
made by those disinclined to adopt soiling
and winter dairying, is, that they involve
employment of more manual labor on a given
number of acres, and that reliable farm labor
is hard to get and troublesome to keep. This
is the first superficial pretext of nine-tenths
of those advanced enough to ever give these
subjects a serious thought. Nevertheless, the
practice of these innovations are essential in
the higher grade of farming; and that practice,
instead of being an ill, is a blessing to
the farm, to the farmer, to his older children,
and to the hired laborer; for it gives all of
them steady and profitable employment, while
the present system requires the far greater
proportion of labor in the spring and summer
months, and furnishes less to do in winter for
the hired man and the grown-up boys and
girls. They thus lounge, often, in debasing
idleness, or are early weaned from the
farm, and go away, never to return to partake
of its real, invigorating life, its independence,
and its joys. The dairy, with the accompaniment
of soiling and more production of dairy
products in the winter, would make the farm
more like a factory, with every wheel in motion
almost the entire year. The home and
the family of the dairy farmer should be as
large as the capacity of the man and the woman
at the helm; and as steady employment
as that which must be given to the store or
shop would go a long way in developing and
increasing the capacity of the whole force to
manage more. Giving regular employment
to good men on the farm makes it far easier
to get and to keep them; and it retains a more
brawny set of men, who are otherwise enticed
to the factories and railways that give
steady work, and so have the pick of the intelligent
and most reliable ones. It is an accomplishment
in a farmer and his wife to
know how to get, and how to keep good,
faithful hired men. I know of those who are
slaves, because they don’t know how. Many
of them ascribe it to the men, when they
themselves are principally at fault. There is
a mortal dread of “tramps,” especially among
the more ignorant farmers. But I aver that
the common system of almost exclusive grain
farming that crowds most of the labor of the
year into a few spring and summer months,
is a direct cause of much of the tramp evil of
which so many farmers complain. It manufactures
the tramps who rove from necessity,
and even drives out their own children to
swell the ranks of those in search of a job.
On the other hand, a large increase of milk-stock
kept on the farm necessitates the retention
of most of the manual force of the summer
months. Not how to dispense with hired
labor or the labor of his children, but how to
profitably employ and elevate it, and make it
inviting, rather than abhorrent and slavish, is
the problem the progressive farmer should
study to solve. The manufacturer counts
upon additional gains through the addition of
well-employed laborers. The farmer could
do the same if he used more educated brains
and a little less over-taxed muscle in his business.
The bulk of every fortune steadily acquired,
consists of the success of its possessor
in getting, honestly or dishonestly, a profit
from the labors of others. This must be so,
so long as it is an axiom in political economy
that labor is the basis of all wealth. The
owner of the soil can succeed in winning
more than a pro rata proportion, just in the
ratio of his ability to make his brains help
the work of his hands.</p>

<p>I know of whole sections, and even contiguous
miles square, on which the system of
farming prevails that I have condemned&mdash;the
hired man is unknown, save only for
short periods of the year&mdash;the children gone
to the cities, to the factories, the railroads, or
to the West&mdash;the land denuded of stock, almost,
as well as of the rightful ones to care
for it; and half-impoverished farms, half
farmed by the old folks, or continuously
cropped on shares by more indigent neighbors.
Possessions that by nature are as fair
as ever the sun shone upon, that do not, and
can not now pay five per cent interest on $25
per acre; when well managed dairy farms
in the same county pay more than that per
cent on a basis of $100 per acre. In view of
these patent facts that stare us in the face, is
it any wonder that some of us feel we have a
loud call to dispense the pure dairy gospel to
these perishing sinners who thus neglect
their grand opportunities.</p>

<p>In some one of the first sentences of this
paper I alluded to the influence of good and
profitable farming in improving the condition
and standing of the farmer, as a man
among men. This, after all, is the crowning
objective point, or should be, of all those who
make the most of the opportunities the great
mass neglect. If with all his getting a man
does not get some real wisdom, some development
in stalwart morality, and a higher cultivation
of the mind, it needs no Solomon or
Bible to tell the on-lookers that he is a comparative
failure; and it ought to be apparent
to himself. The legitimate profits of a higher
grade of farming ought to be expended to
elevate the farmer, his wife, his children, and
all the attendants whom he directs. Part of
them should appear in the form of better and
more comfortable houses and barns, finer
stock, better horses, better roads and school-houses,
a larger list of newspapers and periodicals,
better libraries and better housekeeping,
and more cheery houses in which
intelligence and music are not strangers. It
is as important that a man should spend his
earnings aright, as that he should use his
energies and talents to earn. It is not a manly
element in a man whose chief forte is that he
can hold all he can get. A clam can do that,
and not suffer much, either, in a comparison
of brains with the groveling getter of mere
wealth. The high behest to earn much, by
and through grand opportunities to labor and
direct labor, blossoms into blessing in its best
sense only when the earnings are spent to
increase the intelligence, add to the comforts,
and aid men to discharge their private and
public duties more nobly than it is possible
for a man to do with an income that simply
gives him bread.</p>

<p>Because the earnings of the farm are not
more frequently spent in thus installing a
section of paradise on the farm, is the real
cause of the stampede therefrom of many of
the smart ones who deem the struggle for
elevation there a hopeless one, and, catching
an inspiration from the shriek of civilization
that announces each swiftly flying train, they
turn their backs on what have been to them
farm dungeons, and mingle with the surging
throng in quest of a better condition. That
they are often mistaken and baffled in taking
such a route, does not deter a new crowd
from going. They fly from what they dread,
as much as they are inspired by what they
hope to win. These things ought not so to
be; and a wise improvement of the many
neglected opportunities on the farm would
go far to rectify the ills they fly from, but
from which yet few escape.</p>

<p>Say what we will about all its defects, its
uninviting toil, and low wages, agriculture
disenthralled of its ignorance is the basis
rock of our hope; and he is a slanderer of the
noblest occupation who raises the veil to
expose its defects and servility for any other
purpose than to help make greener its verdure,
and brighten its bloom.</p>

<h3>The Farmer’s Garden.</h3>

<p class="p3">BY J. M. SMITH.</p>


<p>A few years ago it was necessary for me to
call upon a gentleman upon some business.
After my business was completed and I was
about to leave, I started toward the garden.
He called to me saying, “Do not go there&mdash;you
can not get through the garden.” I arrived
at the border and stopped. He had evidently
complied with one of the necessities
of a good garden, viz., plenty of manure, for
it is simply impossible for weeds to grow at
the rate, or attain the size they had there, except
upon very rich land.</p>

<p>Rabbits would have been perfectly secure
from foxes, and foxes from dogs, in that immense
and tangled growth of weeds.</p>

<p>The owner of that garden was one the best
and most enterprising farmers in the State.
He had at one time been president of his
State agricultural society.</p>

<p>Many years ago I visited a friend living
upon a 160 acre farm. It was one of the most
beautiful section farms that I have ever seen
either in this or any other State. While there
I was speaking of a splendid crop of melons
that were then just ripening. He said, in
rather a fretful manner, “I do not see why
my melons do not grow. I know the land is
rich, and there are no weeds in the hills. I
hoed them all up only a few days ago.” I
walked out to his garden with him, and there
were his poor, puny vines struggling for life.
As he said, there were no weeds in the hills,
a little circle of perhaps two or three feet in
diameter had been hoed out, and the balance
of the land was covered with a dense growth
of weeds from two to six feet in height.</p>

<p>He had a most industrious and refined lady
for a wife, and young children growing up
around him, and, as before stated, a most excellent
as well as valuable farm. Yet not one
early pea or one ear of sweet corn; not even
early potatoes or a tomato, or, in fact, anything
that by any stretch of the imagination
could be called a garden bed&mdash;yet the man
has been to college.</p>

<p>Another gentleman said in my presence,
“In the spring, at the proper time, I purchase
cabbage seed and sow them; when it is time
to set them out I buy the plants and plant
them; when it is time for cabbages they are
<i>there</i>, and so I always have cabbages.”</p>

<p>He is among the very best farmers in the
State. He teaches others how to farm, and
does it well. The man who attacks him in a
convention needs a strong cause and a ready
tongue, or he will be apt to consider his own
cause a very poor one before he gets through
with it. This man has been president of a
State dairymen’s association.</p>

<p>One case more: Another gentleman, who
is far above the average farmer, and who has
also been president of a State dairymen’s association,
as well as a public teacher, as he
was going out to attend a farmers’ meeting
or convention, where he was expected to be a
teacher, happened to look out over the place
where his garden should have been, and saw
an immense growth of weeds going to seed.
He said to his sons and hired men, “Boys,
bring out a team and hitch to the mower, and
mow off the garden; I can not conscientiously
go and teach others how to farm with that
crop of weeds going to seed in my own
garden.” The work was done. “There,”
said he, “I can now go and teach without a
troubled conscience. There are no weeds
going to seed in my garden.”</p>

<p>I have strong hopes of this gentleman. He
has a conscience. He attends church; and
although I consider him intellectually as far
superior to most of the preachers of the day,
yet if the right man should become his pastor,
I fully believe that there is salvation for him
even in this life.</p>

<p>As to the other three the case seems at least
to be a very doubtful one. One can not but be
reminded of the anecdote of the three little
boys who had commenced studying the catechism.
Some one asked them if they had
learned any of it? “Oh, yes,” says one of
them, “I am past justification.” A second
one says, “I am past sanctification.” The
third jumps up and says, “I have beat them
all; I am clear past redemption.” It is much
to be feared that the three first described
gentlemen are all of them clear past redemption.</p>

<p>Let us turn for a moment to a farmer’s
garden of another order. He has a beautiful
as well as an excellent farm. Around his
house are quite a number of handsome trees
that stood there when the Indians were the
proprietors of the soil. The present owner
has added such other trees as he thought
would add both to its beauty and comfort.
The house is a number of rods from the highway,
and in the summer is one of the most
beautiful rural homes that I ever saw. Back
of, and near by, the house is his garden. It is
so arranged that most of its crops can be cultivated
with a horse and cultivator. A nice
asparagus bed furnishes not only himself and
family an abundant supply of this the first
as well as one of the best of the products of
the outdoor garden, but also a quantity to
sell. His strawberry beds, containing only a
few of the standard varieties and a very few
plants of some of the most promising of the
new ones, were models of both beauty and
economy in their arrangement for cultivating
both well and cheaply. The same was true
of his peas, beans, sweet corn, cabbages, potatoes,
etc. His raspberries, both red and
black-caps, furnished an abundant supply for
the family during their season. The same is
true of his blackberries and grapes.</p>

<p>A short distance from these well cared-for
necessaries and luxuries of his farm is a moderate-sized
and well cared-for orchard. I have
no doubt he can, if he wishes, have some of
the products of his orchard or garden, or both,
upon his table every day of the year.</p>

<p>The gentleman who owns and controls this
farm has never been president of any State
dairymen’s association, nor has he ever been
sent to Congress. But, gentlemen, he is one
of the most thoroughly wide awake and enterprising,
as well as one of the very best
farmers that Wisconsin can boast of; and we
have some good ones.</p>

<p>The question very naturally arises, Why
is it that so many, not only of our common,
but of our very best farmers, fail to have
anything that can be called even a poor garden?
It is not because they do not like its
products.</p>

<p>Time and again have men who were good
farmers, when looking over my grounds, said:
“Well, it is too bad that I have not had a decent
garden; but I am determined to have
one after this, and will neglect it no longer.”
I have no recollection of any farmer’s family
among my acquaintances who would not enjoy
its products. Perhaps the best reason,
and often the only one, that can be given for
so many almost entire failures in this respect
is the want of time. It is a well-known fact
that almost all of our farmers are short of the
help they really need to keep their farms in
good condition. Something is sure to be neglected,
and, in three cases out of four, if not
in nine out of ten, the poor garden is the first
thing that is left to care for itself, which it
generally does by growing a tremendous crop
of weeds.</p>

<p>It is perfectly useless to attempt to have a
respectable garden, unless arrangements are
made in the spring for its planting and cultivation
with the same care that arrangements
are made for the care of the wheat, oats, corn,
or potato crop, or the care of the dairy.</p>

<p>When these arrangements are made and
faithfully carried into execution during the
season, then shall we see good gardens upon
our farms; and not only that, but, as a rule,
they will be the best paying pieces of land
upon the farm, not only in the comfort they
give to the family, but in the profit as well.</p>

<p>I do not propose at this time to give you a
treatise upon gardening. A few hints that
may be of value to those who wish to make
some improvement, is all that will be attempted.</p>

<p>In the first place, select, if you can have a
choice, a piece of light, loamy soil, with a little
sand, if you can get it. A heavy clay soil
will raise as large a crop as the one above
mentioned, but it is not as early, and is much
more expensive and different to work. In
laying out a garden on a farm take plenty of
room, and arrange the goods in such a manner
that the greatest possible amount of work
can be performed with the horse.</p>

<p>The selection of seeds is to me the most annoying
and perplexing job of the season. The
circulars come pouring in, and are filled with
the names of new varieties of this and that
and the other, each better than any other of
its kind, and so very desirable that you are
apt to think that you must have a few of the
seeds just to try them.</p>

<p>Of course, there is occasionally some improvement
made in vegetables and plants
but it is safe to say that in nineteen cases out
of twenty the farmer or the amateur who invests
in some new varieties of seeds or plants
upon the recommendation of his circular,
loses both money and time by the operation.
If I should record my own experience in this
line during the past twenty-five years, the result
would show that I have drawn an occasional
prize and a marvelous number of blanks,
and some of them very annoying, as well as
expensive ones.</p>

<p>I will give you a list of such seeds as have
proven themselves to be about the best that I
can find, after years of experience:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Asparagus&mdash;Conover’s Colossal.</p>

<p>Beets&mdash;Early Egyptian for first early; Early Blood
Turnip for fall and winter.</p>

<p>Carrots&mdash;Early Scarlet-Horn.</p>

<p>Parsnips&mdash;Common Dutch Hollow-crown.</p>

<p>Ruta Bagas&mdash;American purple top, imp.</p>

<p>Turnips&mdash;Flat Dutch.</p>

<p>Bush Beans&mdash;German Dwarf Black Wax.</p>

<p>Pole do.&mdash;Lima.</p>

<p>Cucumbers&mdash;White Spine.</p>

<p>Cabbage&mdash;First Early Jersey Wakefield; Fall and
Winter, Prem. Flat Dutch.</p>

<p>Celery&mdash;Golden Dwarf.</p>

<p>Muskmelons&mdash;Early White, Japan, and Hackensack.</p>

<p>Watermelons&mdash;Mountain Sweet.</p>

<p>Cauliflower&mdash;Early Dwarf, Eurfart.</p>

<p>Peas&mdash;Extra early Dan O’Rourke, American Wonder,
Champion of England.</p>

<p>Summer Squash&mdash;Round Scallop, American Turban,
Hubbard.</p>

<p>Lettuce&mdash;Curled Simpson and Boston Market.</p>

<p>Pepper&mdash;Large Bell and Butternosed.</p>

<p>Tomato&mdash;Trophy and Acme.</p>

<p>Sweet Corn&mdash;Early Minn., Crosby’s Early, Stowell’s
Evergreen. These if planted at same time will give proper
succession.</p>

<p>Radishes&mdash;French Breakfast, and Covent Garden.</p></div>

<p>When we come to the small fruits I will
recommend as follows: Strawberries&mdash;Wilson’s
Albany seedling for main crop. If a
few very large ones are wanted try the No.
30, and the Sharpless. With me they are both
worthless except for the purpose of producing
a few very large berries. To lengthen
out the season the Kentucky is the best of
any that I know of. Downer’s Prolific is also
a fair bearer, of excellent quality. I am constantly
trying those of the new varieties that
seem to me most likely to do well, but almost
invariably lose both time and money. I have
some twelve or fifteen varieties of these now
on trial, but presume the result with nearly
or quite all, will be the same as with hundreds
of others I have had during the last
twenty-five years, viz., after two or three
years of trouble and expense plow them under
for manure.</p>

<p>For raspberries, the Doolittle and the
Mammoth Cluster have done nicely among
the black-caps. The Gregg is also highly
recommended by those who have tried it.
I have not tried it a sufficient time to tell
what it will do with me. The Philadelphia is
a standard among the reds, and justly so.
After two or three years’ trial I think very
highly of the Cuthbert, although with me it
is not as hardy as the Philadelphia. In fact,
they all do better for being covered in winter.</p>

<p>Blackberries. For this portion of the State
I know of nothing that I believe would give
better satisfaction than Stone’s Hardy.</p>

<p>Among currants, the Red and White Dutch
are still the standards.</p>

<p>The Concord grape is yet among grapes
about what the Wilson is among strawberries&mdash;the
standard for the million. The Worden,
a seedling of the Concord, is very promising,
and may yet prove to be a strong competitor
in the race. The Delaware does splendidly
in the Fox River Valley, but is not as reliable
in all parts of the State as the above-named
varieties.</p>

<p>I have tried to recommend nothing but
what will do well with good fair cultivation
upon any good soil. Yet you will often be
annoyed in selecting seed, from the fact that
the same seed is sent out by different seedsmen
under different names. For instance, I
have had early peas sent to me under different
names and by different seedsmen and all
planted on the same day, side by side, all
cared for precisely alike, and all alike claiming
to be remarkably early and prolific as
well as excellent in quality, and yet every
one of them precisely like the old extra early
Dan O’Rourke that I used to grow, I do not
know how many years ago.</p>

<p>The American Wonder is the only one of
the new varieties that I have tried in many
years that really seems to be an acquisition
to our list. It is a dwarf about second early,
and with me a good bearer, and of excellent
quality. I mention this to show the farmer
that as a rule it is better for him to rely upon
the old standard list, until some grower with
whom he is acquainted has fairly tested the
new variety, and ascertained whether or not
they are worthy of cultivation, and some
good common sense are all that is needed to
insure a good farmers garden. In twenty-five
years I have failed but once to harvest at
least a paying crop of strawberries, and most
of the time they have been both large and
profitable. During that time I have failed
once to have a corn crop, and have a number
of times failed to have a paying crop of potatoes;
in fact, I have failed oftener with my
potatoes than with any other of the long list
of crops that I attempt to grow. Yet if I
should say to the farmers of this audience
that they did not know how to grow a crop
of potatoes, they would consider themselves
insulted, though I presume that not one of
them has had complete success with them for
any long series of years.</p>

<p>Peas and onions should be put in as early
as the land is in good condition to work in
the spring. If the ground freezes hard soon
after they are sprouted it will not injure
them. Parsnips, beets, carrots, radishes, turnips,
cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, and salsify
will all bear a little frost after they come
up, but not much.</p>

<p>Corn, beans, peppers, tomatoes, vines of all
kinds, require a warm soil and will do their
best in no other.</p>

<p>A place for the wife and children’s flowers
should not be forgotten or neglected. Give
them a place, furnish help to prepare and care
for it, and do not complain about the little
time and expense it takes, either. Probably
you will neither eat nor sell the flowers, but
they will pay you better than a few extra
bushels of wheat would. We are apt to hear
complaints at our conventions that the young
men will persist in leaving their farm home
and seeking a new one in some of the towns
or cities. Well, when I am traveling in our
own and in other States and see so many desolate,
dreary places that are called farmhouses&mdash;no
trees, no shrubbery, no fruit, no
flowers, no garden, in fact, nothing but a
shell of a house, and some land, and it is fair
to suppose that it is about as cheerless inside
the house as it is dreary outside of it, I often
wonder how, or why, any bright, active,
wide-awake young man can stay there one
day after he is at liberty to leave.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I know that there are many
beautiful exceptions to the above described
homes, and that they are yearly becoming
more numerous. If the exceptions could become
the universal rule, what a glorious
Northwest we should have! Presidents of
State agricultural societies would not have to
warn their friends against attempting to get
through the tangled mass of weeds called the
garden. The man who has been to college
would no longer fret because his vines
could not grow. The President of the State
Dairymen’s Association would no longer buy
cabbage plants or cabbage. Neither would
he be compelled to order out his team and
mow his garden before his conscience would
allow him to teach others how to farm.</p>

<p>Instead of these, should be homes beautiful,
homes bright, homes happy&mdash;so happy that
the young would be loath to leave and glad to
return. As our Northwest is the grandest
portion of our republic, so should our homes
be the most beautiful, and the inmates thereof
the most intelligent as well as the happiest
and most contented citizens of our wide
domain.</p>

<h3><a name="Our_Future_Orchards" id="Our_Future_Orchards">Our Future Orchards.</a></h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Granting our Apple Orchards on High
lands, Ridges, and Slopes are Suffering,
or Starving from Insufficient Moisture,
What will be our best course with them?</p></div>


<h4><i>Number Four.</i></h4>

<p>In the first place, it may be well to enlarge
a little on the subject of deficient moisture
the average orchard is liable to on prairie and
all other Western soils of a drift origin, where
the strata lie nearly parallel to the plane of
the earth’s surface. Here there are, therefore,
few, if any, of those springs or fountains
of water which often supply abundant
moisture to land of considerable slope and
elevation. If this difference in geological
conditions is taken into account, it will explain
why, in many sections, orchards often
do quite remarkably well on hillsides and
mountain slopes.</p>

<p>There is little or no resemblance between
the apple tree and the orange tree, when
both are botanically considered; but considered
from the point of view as a source of
fruit, the one is the best product of warm climates,
and the other of cold ones; both being
esteemed nearly universally. The orange being
a very juicy, and at the same time, a fruit
in which sweet and sour are equally blended,
requires a moist soil and a large supply of
water, in addition to a relatively high temperature.
Accordingly, when grown in warm
but dry climates, as in Spain and along the
north shore of the Mediterranean, the ground
bearing orange trees is uniformly copiously
irrigated two or three times a month, during
the warm season, and every two months in
the winter. The orange-producing portion of
Louisiana is mostly confined to the sixty or
seventy square miles of cultivatable land
along the Mississippi river banks, south of
New Orleans. Here the soil is alluvial and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
sandy, the rainfall sixty or seventy inches per
annum, and the state of the atmosphere so
continuously humid, as to drape all arboreal
vegetation with moss. Florida has the same
rainfall, the same humid atmosphere, the
same moss, with the advantage of a soil quite
as sandy, in which, as constitutes elements,
phosphoric acid and potash abound in far
greater proportions than in the alluvial of the
Mississippi. And it is probably due to this
happy association of heat, humidity, a sandy
soil, rich in the phosphates of lime and salts
of potash, that Florida oranges really are, and
are regarded the best in the world. But in
spite of these advantages, and another, no less
important&mdash;that by capillary attraction,
through the sand&mdash;the orange roots have direct
and easy access to water beneath; it is found
that the trees do better if mulched to prevent
evaporation during the cool months&mdash;they being
the dry season, while the summer months
are the wet. The Louisiana orange-growers
go farther; they not only mulch liberally
with rice straw every year, but in addition,
every third or fourth year, from eight inches
to a foot of the earth under the trees is removed
and new earth put in its place.</p>

<p>From these statements we get some idea of
the amount of water the orange tree demands
in the soil, and the measure of moisture in
the atmosphere, to supply evaporation from
its large evergreen leaf surface and fill its
fruit with juice. An apple tree is not an orange
tree, to be sure, but when in leaf, and
bearing a heavy crop of fruit, the farmer
must necessarily make large drafts on the
soil to meet the surface evaporation and supply
the required juice to its fruit. Every tree
in leaf is a pump, constantly drawing on the
soil and drying it, and in all reasonable probability
the drafts are in proportion to fruit
and foliage. Has any body calculated the
daily demand for moisture a twenty-five-year
old Northern Spy, or Baldwin, carrying
twenty or thirty bushels of apples makes on
the soil beneath and around it during the hot
and dry months of August and September?
The quantity probably is largely in excess of
the common estimate, and perhaps not half
required by the orange&mdash;but it is so much it
affords a sufficient reason why such trees
grow faster, are healthier, and bear more and
better fruit, on lands that are moist, than on
lands that are dry.</p>

<p>But orchards on high lands, or on slopes, or
on slopes and ridges, suffering for moisture,
can not be removed to low lands, nor can they
be irrigated, except at an enormous expense.
What then can be done? In the first place,
the annual rainfall can be held to the space
it falls upon, under the tree, by the throwing
up a furrow or ridge around it, as far out as
the limbs extend, where the ground is level,
and by a dam on the lower side, when the
ground slopes. The latter could also be made
to stay a portion of the rain falling on the
higher ground above. Further: a general
system of mulching ought to be adopted; not
for the purpose alone of keeping the surface
moist, but also for supplying food to the roots
as the mulch decays. If the orchard is in
grass, clover, or weeds, they should be mowed
at least twice a year, the burden suffered to
lie on the ground and rot, or be thrown under
the trees. After pruning, the wood removed
should either be left where it falls, or piled in
heaps about the orchard and suffered to rot
as in the “hammock” land orange groves of
Florida, where the under brush and extra timber
is rarely burned, but piled in heaps to rot
away.</p>

<p>If it is desirable to bring barren trees into
bearing, or to rescue them from decay and
death those in an unhealthy state, measures
of a more radical and expensive character
must be taken, measures similar to those
which have been practiced for centuries with
the grape vine, with complete success. These
measures consist either in removing the
earth under the trees and putting new and
fresh earth in its place, as practiced with
orange trees in Louisiana, and on the coffee
plantations in the tropics, or in digging a
deep and wide ditch around the tree, inside
the outer diameter of the branches, and refilling
it with near half the earth removed
and half such mineral fertilizers and amendments
as tree leaves and refuse decaying
vegetable matter of any sort for the other
half.</p>

<p>But nothing more than a general outline of
the course to be pursued can be indicated
here; and nothing more is necessary for the
intelligent amateur, fruit-grower, or orchardist,
who feels the strength of the proof, and
accepts the situation.</p>

<p>In these latter days most of the diseases
which afflict humanity are believed to be attributable
to improper nutrition and faulty
hygiene, and are relieved or cured by a more
or less radical change in food and habitat.</p>

<p>In the animal world, the truth appears in a
still stronger light; while in the vegetable
kingdom, nutrition counts for almost everything.
Still, in the case of the peach yellows
and pear blight, both appear, on first sight, to
be distinct diseases, neither yielding to any
remedy yet applied to them, and both being
attended with the present fashionable bacteria,
which are made responsible for many
diseases and all epidemics. But has anybody
yet made the experiment whether water
supplied copiously to the spare and thin
roots of the pear will or will not prevent the
blight, or tried the same thing with the
peach? We all know the gigantic and venerable
pear trees of the Wabash and Kaskaskia
country were planted on the sandy second
bottoms of the rivers named, where in their
early youth, if not in their mature age, water
was always within easy reach of their roots;
and we have seen the item in the agricultural
papers telling how one experimenter at
least, has saved his pear trees from blight by
copious watering. The prairie and timber
country both are drying out and losing soil
moisture very much faster than we have any
conception of. Situations where moisture in
the soil was abundant enough for all crop
purposes twenty-five years ago, suffered
quickly after a brief drought now, and would
be benefited by irrigation where it would have
been injurious fifty years before. Beside, we
have borrowed many of our ideas from the
fruit-growing experiences of the East, and
they from the cooler and moister countries
of Europe. And in that way the amount of
right teaching has been too attenuated, until
it is in many respects practically worthless.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Model_Illinois_Nursery" id="The_Model_Illinois_Nursery">The Model Illinois Nursery.</a></h3>

<p>We have visited in our time very many
nurseries both East and West. We have seen
those East where the elaboration of landscape
gardening was made to add effect to and set
off the nursery stock grown. We have seen
West hundreds of acres covered with stock in
a single nursery. Yet we have never seen
the perfection of details coupled with strict
accuracy as to name in the varieties of stock
grown, united to evenness and vigor in
growth, nor a stricter method displayed in
adaptation of varieties suited to the climate
of the West, added to the most perfect cultivation
and handling of stock, than at the premium
nurseries of Spaulding &amp; Co., near
Springfield, Ill.</p>

<p>These nurseries, covering 375 acres originally,
of first-class land, were thoroughly tile-drained,
at heavy expense before anything
was planted thereon, the land having been
first cleaned and stumped of its timber. Thus,
the groundwork having been laid for a great
and model nursery, under the management of
Mr. J. B. Spaulding, a well-known nurseryman
of many years’ standing in Illinois, and
whose practical experience from a critical
standpoint is perhaps broader than that of
any man in the West, it is not strange that
whenever entered for premium before the
State Board of Agriculture, such should have
been unanimously awarded by the committee
of examination. This, however, the records
of the board will show.</p>

<p>In speaking of the artistic adornment of
some old and extensive nurseries East, we
find this difference: In the nurseries of Mr. J.
B. Spaulding the useful is never lost sight of.
Mere ornament is not what strikes the visitor,
and yet the nursery is one beautiful picture
in its varied and blending colors of fruit,
flowers, and foliage; for the orchard and garden
are by no means neglected&mdash;the visitor
can find the fruits themselves, the crucial
test. It is worth the journey to see.</p>

<p>The immense stock, the ample building, the
splendid drives, the office connected with the
Western Union Telegraph lines by telephone,
and everything pertaining to the great nursery,
is kept in the most perfect condition.
Blight and borers are strangers to their 10,000
orchard trees of pear, peach, chestnut, and
apples, all of varieties unexcelled, and adapted
to the soil and climate of the West. The real
gist of the whole, however, lies in the record
of sales of this nursery for the fall delivery
just closed, which amounts to nearly $120,000.</p>

<p>The most gratifying success has attended
the efforts of this firm in growing stock. Of
150,000 buds set the past season, comprising
cherries, pears, plums, and peaches, almost
no rebudding has been required, and their
stand is unexampled. It is not strange that
the firm have the approval of the State Board
of Agriculture and nurserymen of experience
East and West, especially from the large
nurseries proprietors of Western New York.
All unite in saying Spaulding &amp; Co.’s grounds,
comprising upward of 375 acres, thoroughly
tile-drained, for the growing of nursery stock,
are unsurpassed. The 1,500,000 one, two, and
three-year old apple trees, and 175,000 one,
two, and three-year old cherry trees&mdash;the latter
budded on Mahaleb roots, imported from
France&mdash;together with their enormous stock
of evergreens, pears, roses, shrubs, etc., are
matchless in their perfection of growth,
whether it be from an Eastern or Western
standpoint.</p>

<p>In driving through the nursery we were
shown a large block of American chestnuts,
from five to eight feet high, and thence were
driven to the chestnut orchard nearly all in
bearing. The chestnut here seems fully as
much at home as any other plant cultivated.</p>

<p>For the protection of their patrons against
outside imposition, each of their nearly one
hundred selected salesmen are accredited
with a certificate of agency.</p>

<p>The long experience of this firm, being
nearly thirty years in the business at Springfield,
Ill.; the reputation they enjoy; the approval
and indorsement they receive from
the State&mdash;all commend this nursery to the
favorable attention of those who have ground
upon which to plant shrubbery or trees.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="The_Basket_Willow" id="The_Basket_Willow">The Basket Willow.</a></h3>


<p>A correspondent wishes some information
about the basket willow. In Onondaga county,
Central New York, this willow is cultivated
and manufactured on a large scale and
is, in fact, a leading industry. The cultivation
is increasing very rapidly and is a great
benefit to this and neighboring counties. The
baskets made from this willow are better and
cheaper than the splint basket, and raising
the stock is found to pay much better than
other farm crops, while the manufacture gives
employment to hundreds of men, women, and
children, who would otherwise have nothing
to do during the winter.</p>

<p>These willows are grown on high land and
on low land, on wet and dry land, and on very
cheap land, and on land that is worth one
thousand dollars per acre. The crop needs
to be planted but once, and an average yearly
crop can not be worth less than one hundred
dollars per acre. As the timber suitable
for baskets is getting scarce and dear, it is
plain that the demand for willow will increase
every year. In most parts of the
country are Germans who understand
working the willow, and it is a great benefit
to them and to their neighbors to
have this industry introduced. Not one
farmer in a dozen has on his place as
many baskets as he needs, for the reason
that they are scarce and dear. This willow
is the easiest thing in the world to raise, and
yet we import from Europe $5,000,000 worth
a year.</p>

<p>About two hundred tons of willow are
manufactured every year in one little village
in this State. One man in Syracuse told me
he should send to New York this winter one
hundred and forty tons of peeled willow,
mostly of his own growing. In all the
large cities more or less willow is manufactured
every year, and the amount thus worked
in the city of Milwaukee is very large. This
industry is a benefit to the whole community
and deserves to be encouraged, and the West
especially should take a deep interest in extending
it. The fact that it gives employment
to poor during the winter, thus making
comfort take the place of want, should exert
a great influence in its favor. Here then is a
means by which the farmer can put money
in his pocket and help his poor neighbor at
the same time. I have no interest in this
matter as I do not raise, buy, or sell, but I
do know it has been a great blessing to our
State. There is one variety grown here that
is much preferred to any other, but I can not
find out the true name for it. Even the man
that brought it here does not know its name.</p>

<p>In a future number I will give directions
for planting, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> is a little <span class="smcap">Prairie Farmer</span> toast
that we like, and though we get such often,
we never tire of it. It was prepared by Mr.
J. W. Hall, of Bates Co., Mo.: “<span class="smcap">The Prairie
Farmer</span>, the Western man’s friend. It
grows better all the time; may it continue
the good work.” We respond to all such
toasts by striving to better deserve them every

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> esteemed correspondent, Alex. Ross,
this week tells farmers how they may keep
their pork fresh for summer use. It will be
generally regretted, we fear, that Mr. Ross
did not contribute this article earlier in the
season. It is timely to those who have not
yet salted their pork, and for those who have,
the recipe will keep, as well as the pork, until
another season. Do you all file <span class="smcap">The Prairie

essays than these two, that is the publication
we should like to see. The dairymen have a
little the best of it, for dairymen all need good

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> have a barbarous way of testing the
comparative strength of draft horses in some
parts of England. At Huddersfield the other
day two owners secured the tail-ends of their
carts together and then put their teams to
the draft to see which would give way. First
one and then the other was drawn backward,
“<i>while the macadam was torn up to the
depth of five inches by their struggles</i>.” The
horses were kicked and beaten to make them
do their best. The London Live Stock Journal
says the brutes, the men we mean, not the
horses, were arrested and fined $5 each for
their fun. It should have been $500 apiece
and imprisonment. The whipping post is
none too severe for such criminal inhumanity
to man’s most useful animal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">France</span> has about one-half the agricultural
implements in use that England has, though
the cultivated acres in France are greatly in
excess of those of England. The reason,
doubtless, lies in the fact that French farms are
very small and do not warrant the purchase
of the larger labor-saving machines. The
manual labor of the members of the family is
often sufficient to carry on almost all the operations
of the little farm “patches.” The
late French census gives the following list of
implements: 4,800,000 plow and diggers of
various kinds, 1,650,000 harrows, 20,000 drills,
15,000 mowing machines, 18,000 reapers, 60,000
chaff-cutters, and 55,000 root-cutters. As
compared with our own country this is indeed
a small showing. We have dozens of reaper
factories that turn out yearly more machines
than are owned in all France.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> readers will notice that in our premium
list, as sent out last week, the Saskatchewan
fife wheat is among the prominent offers.
Here is a pointer showing the estimation in
which the wheat is held by those who have
grown it. We take it from the Detroit Record:
“Last Spring twenty-six members of
the Becker County Farmers’ Union clubbed
together to the extent of $5 each for the purpose
of giving the Scotch fife wheat (as
grown in the Saskatchawan Valley) a trial,
and the result has been most satisfactory.
Thirteen bushels of the wheat were bought
at $10 per bushel, and Iver Christianson, of
Richwood, sowed it on thirteen acres of new
land, for one-fourth of the yield. The
wheat was threshed last Wednesday and divided
among the stockholders yesterday,
each receiving twelve bushels for his investment
of five dollars, the total yield being 403
bushels, 61 pounds to the bushel, of the finest
quality of No. 1 hard. Mr. Wellman, of
whom the said wheat was purchased, began
growing the wheat several years ago from a
few kernels received in a letter from the
Saskatchawan Valley, and the grain has
been hand picked and kept perfectly clean
each year.” The members of the club express
themselves as perfectly satisfied with
results and indorse the wheat in the highest
manner. In all our premiums we have aimed
to select useful articles, and such as are calculated
to meet the wants of farmers and friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Northern Illinois Horticultural Society
held an interesting meeting at Elgin last
week. The attendance was not large, but included
such life long leaders in Illinois horticulture
as A. R. Whitney, S. G. Minkler, J.
W. Cochrane, D. C. Schofield, A. Bryant, Jr.,
Dr. Slade, Wm. Kellogg, of Wisconsin, D.
Wilmot Scott, H. Graves, A. L. Small, L.
Woodard, and others. The papers read were
brief and excellent. Robert Douglas, O. B.
Galusha, and Samuel Edwards, who were not
present contributed instructive essays. The
election for the ensuing year resulted in the
choice of S. M. Slade, Elgin, President; A.
Bryant, Jr., Princeton, J. V. Cotta, Mt. Carroll,
and David Hill, Dundee, Vice-Presidents;
D. Wilmot Scott, Galena, Secretary; E. W.

Recording Secretaries. The society voted

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> alleged operations of certain patent
sharks as recorded on third page of this paper
reminds us of a couple of swindling operations
humorously noticed in a late New York
Tribune, viz: Certain Michigan farmers
gave their notes, ranging from $50 to $500
each, for “hulless oats,” payment to be made
out of the crop produced at $1.50 per bushel.
But the I. O. U.’s were promptly sold on liberal
terms at the bank or elsewhere. The
persuasive agent “lighted out,” and the victims
now think they perceive symptoms of
the cutting of belated teeth, of the eye variety.
Another interesting “little game” is this:
Two men, apparently strangers, meet at a
farm-house; get acquainted; arrange to stay
over night. During the long evening they
make a bargain with each other for some
piece of property, draw writings, and ask
their host kindly to append his name as witness.
Just as might have been expected, the
farmer’s signature turns out to be the most
important of the three, since the document is
so artfully constructed that by cutting it in
two pieces one of them becomes a promissory
note, which is subsequently negotiated, and,
under the present bad law, has to be paid.&mdash;In
view of such occurrences as these (still astonishingly
common after years of repeated
exposure by the press) the aggressive “Jabez”
of the Tribune maintains that the countryman
who doesn’t treat as frauds all tramps,
no matter how well dressed, who seek his
autograph, under any pretense whatever,
would better have given his time to reading
and not learned to write, for these bad signs
indicate that he will never be forethoughtful
enough in such emergencies to make his
mark.</p>

<p>The fifth annual meeting of the Mississippi
Valley Horticultural Society held at Kansas
City, Mo., January 22-25, was the most interesting
and profitable ever held by this vigorous
and valuable organization. Delegates
were present from fourteen States, covering
the great water-shed embraced by the “Father
of Waters,” and its tributaries&mdash;in and of
itself, an empire. The personnel of this body
was excellent; it was a convention of practical,
brainy men, alive to the interests of one
of the most important pursuits in range of
the rural industries. The essays, and the discussions
they provoked, were full of interest,
and highly instructive. We have attended
scores of such assemblies during the last
quarter of a century; none of them equaled
this, all things considered, and we think this
opinion was shared by the oldest and most
prominent among those in attendance.</p>

<p>Our columns, as we find on our return home,
are too crowded this week to admit of publishing
a synopsis of the proceedings, but will
make room for the eloquent, touching, and
well-deserved tribute of the society to the
memory of Dr. John A. Warder. Next week
an epitome of the work of the convention
will be given, and two of the papers that
were read will also appear, to wit: “The Best
Fruit Packages,” by E. T. Hollister, of St.
Louis, Mo., and “The Educational Influence
of Horticulture,” by Mr. G. A. Lyon, of
Galesburg, Ill. Other valuable and interesting
papers read at this meeting will soon appear
in <span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span>; among them,
Prof. S. A. Forbes’ paper on “Insects Affecting
the Strawberry” (which is supplemental
to a former paper which we published last
year); another by Prof. John W. Robson, of
Cheever, Kansas, on the “Circulation of Sap,”
and others which are very useful, on various
leading horticultural topics.</p>

<p>The re-election of Parker Earle, as President,

of the faithful and efficient services of these

<h3><a name="WHEN_IT_IS_TIME_TO_RESIGN" id="WHEN_IT_IS_TIME_TO_RESIGN">WHEN IT IS TIME TO RESIGN.</a></h3>


<p>We observe a general tendency this winter
to re-elect about all the old officers of the various
dairy, horticultural and other meetings,
and this regardless of age or previous terms
of office. While this practice is highly complimentary
to men who have held the positions,
and is a recognition of services well
performed, we think the more frequent infusion
of new blood an excellent remedy for
stagnation and other ills liable to creep into
association management. At several meetings
this winter writers and speakers have
expressed regret that more young men were
not in attendance. Perhaps if the old members
were a little more willing to give young
men a fair proportion of the management
there would be less cause of complaint in
this direction. We have often wondered at
the tenacity with which some old and otherwise
sensible men hold on to offices in State
agricultural societies. They indeed seem to
think it a personal slight if they fail of renomination.
We have in mind one clever
old gentleman, now in almost every way ill-fitted
for the position, who has for long
years held the office of president of a State
Association. Every member of the organization
is aware that the days of this old gentleman’s
usefulness in the position have long
since passed away, yet he was re-elected almost
by acclamation at a late annual meeting.
It was remarked, in our hearing, that
some younger, more vigorous and active man
should be selected, “but,” it was added, “it
would break the old man’s heart to put another
man in his place, and that is the way all
feel about it.” Such a sentiment speaks well
for the hearts of the members with whom the
old gentleman is associated, but less can be
said of the judgment that is manifested. We
respect age, especially if it has been attained
while doing good service for the public. But
something is due to the present and the future
as well as to the past. It is to be regretted
that men do not better recognize the
fact that these little affairs of the world
would move along just about as well if their
management were sometimes resigned to
other hands before death compels the change.
But such is seldom the case. We have known
a man, once a president of a State Agricultural
Society and long one of its vice-presidents,
who has really felt that many of his old
friends and associates became his personal
enemies the moment they aided in electing
another man to his position. He thinks them
so still, yet the fact is he has no more faithful,
well-wishing friends on earth. It was one
of those cases where public good demanded
the sacrifice of private preference. It will be
better for all our organizations when such
adherence to correct principles universally
prevails, or when failing faculties bring with
them self-consciousness of weakening powers.</p>

<h3><a name="LOCATING_THE_MINNESOTA_STATE" id="LOCATING_THE_MINNESOTA_STATE">LOCATING THE MINNESOTA STATE
FAIR.</a></h3>


<p>The Minnesota State Agricultural Association
is now working under the provisions of
the new law passed by the Legislature last
year. This law entitles to vote delegates in
the management of the State Society, from
each county association holding a fair and paying
premiums to the amount of the donation by
the State to these local organizations. At the
late meeting at St. Paul over twenty county
societies were represented. It was also decided
to allow one vote each to the State Horticultural
Society, and to the Southern Minnesota
Fair Association.</p>

<p>The financial report showed that the State
Society received from all sources in 1883 the
sum of $14,068.78. The disbursements amounted
to a little less than this sum. As it is a
matter of interest everywhere to know what
it costs, by items, to run a State society, we
here give them for Minnesota: Salaries of
officers and assistants, $3,601.39; printing and
advertising, $1,415.65; general expenses, $2,520.97;
special ring purses, $2,434; premiums,
$3,945.50.</p>

<p>It will be seen that a little over sixty-one per
cent of the whole amount of prize money
went to the fast horse interest. Thus it is
considered in Minnesota that racing is worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
more money to the State Fair, that is, it brings
more money from attendance and “privileges,”
than all the cattle, farm horses, swine, sheep,
fowls, farm products, vegetables, flowers, machinery,
fine arts, domestic products, and
everything else that can be brought out at
the State exhibition. We do not take Minnesota
as an example because it is any better
or any worse than other States in this respect,
but to show to the farming people of this
country wherein lie the attractions of the
modern agricultural fair. They are at liberty
to draw their own conclusions. These
fairs are in their own hands, or should be,
and if reforms are needed it is from them
that they must emanate.</p>

<p>For several years there has been a feeling
of intense rivalry between the Fair Association
at Minneapolis and the State Society.
The rival fairs have been held at the same
time, and the result has been detrimental to
both organizations. We suppose the feeling
had its birth in the commercial rivalry between
the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis.
However this may have been, or whether
good or ill has resulted, the State Society and
the farmers of the State are to be congratulated
that a movement is on foot to obliterate
all differences, and to establish somewhere
between the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis
permanent fair grounds that shall secure
to Minnesota one of the greatest fairs of the
Northwest. At the meeting, about which we
began to write, it was resolved to instruct a
committee, appointed for the purpose, to negotiate
with the citizens of the two cities for
eighty or one hundred acres of land for a permanent
location of the State Society. It was
also advocated to call upon the Legislature
for appropriations for the construction of permanent
buildings.</p>

<h3><a name="Wayside_Notes" id="Wayside_Notes">Wayside Notes.</a></h3>

<p class="p3">BY A MAN OF THE PRAIRIE.</p>


<p>I can’t help remarking to myself as I read
my two or three foreign agricultural papers,
how great is becoming the influence of
American agriculture upon the farming of
Great Britain. Our ways are gradually insinuating
themselves into British practice
and it will not be long before our respected
“cousins” will be ready to acknowledge that
we have in great part paid off the debt we
owe them for the many lessons in methods of
thorough culture and intelligent breeding
they have given us. What has led me to
mention this matter is an item in a London
journal showing a tendency to bring beef
stock to the block at an earlier age than has
formerly prevailed in that country. It was
not until inaugurated at the Chicago Fat
Stock Show, I believe, that the English ever
took it into their heads to make a record of
average daily gain of bullocks for their Fat
Stock Shows, or of the amount of food it took
to bring them into show condition. It is only
lately that stock raisers there have thought
about selling by weight instead of the “guess”
of the buyer. Farm scales are not half enough
in use here, but we are manifold ahead of the
farmers of Great Britain in this respect. It
was only after Americans had pronounced
upon the benefits of the silo that British
farmers thought it worth their while to experiment
with the innovation from across the
channel. But about this early maturity question:
I notice that a correspondent of the
Yorkshire Post mentions that at the late Fat
Stock Show two Prize Hereford bullocks
weighing (dressed) 896 pounds, and 700
pounds, were aged respectively one year, nine
months, and five days, and one year, seven
months, and twenty-two days. At the Grimsby
show there were two Short-horns weighing
14 cwt. and 13&frac34; cwt. live weight, the first
being one year and nine months old, and the
other one year, nine months, and fourteen days.
They took the second prize as grazing steers.
I don’t need to mention anything about the
new farm implements we have given the old
country, nor the many modifications that her
own implements, wagons, etc., are undergoing,
especially in the way of lightness in
construction, that are directly traceable to
the influence of American manufacture. Indeed,
if the intelligent and unprejudiced
Englishman of to-day who is familiar with
our agriculture will sit down and reflect upon
the subject he will readily acknowledge that
the influence of the United States upon the
political ideas of England has not been more
marked than it has upon her agricultural
ideas and practices.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And while I have strayed so far away from
home for a subject for a “note” I may as well
stay there long enough to say that the English
dog is not a whit less fond of mutton
than is the average canine of this country.
And further, it does not seem that British
law regarding the protection of sheep is at all
in advance of ours, either in its provisions or
the manner of its enforcement. In Cheshire,
for instance, dogs, in the course of the first
two weeks of this year, killed 140 sheep
valued at $1,500, and the most that was done
about it was to hunt up the offending cur&mdash;no
it was not a cur but a Retriever&mdash;and kill
it. The dog is a great favorite in England,
certainly he seems there as here to have more
friends than the sheep that clothes and feeds.
When will man, anywhere, become fully
civilized and humanized?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I met a Wisconsin tobacco and corn-grower
the other day, and he was bluer than a pipe
stem. The frost last fall cut off both his corn
and his tobacco. He said he had actually
nothing to sell but a little wrapper tobacco
which grew in a protected place, and now the
Government had nipped his hopes for this in
the bud by declaring that Sumatra tobacco
should be admitted into the country on a duty
of 35 cents per pound, while it is acknowledged
that it is worth at least five times as
much as the best Wisconsin with which it
competes. Probably a later decision by Secretary
Folger that this Sumatra leaf must
pay 75 cents per pound has done one of his
sores some good. The only thing I could
then, or can now, recommend as good for the
other&mdash;caused by the untimely frost&mdash;is, that
he no longer put all his eggs in one or two
baskets. I am convinced that for farmers of
moderate means through the acceptance of the
doctrine of diversified farming alone lies their
permanent and universal salvation from financial
hades in this world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the Punjaub, British India, there was
last year an outbreak of the cattle plague.
The authorities took hold of the matter, and
by means of isolation of affected cattle and
the prescriptions of the veterinarians, the disease
was completely eradicated. The authorities
were jubilant over their success. The
natives were congratulated on being ruled
over by a Government which kept such excellent
watch over their interests. But the
natives, while they admitted the existence of
the disease, wherein they were more intelligent
or less prejudiced than are some of our
citizens regarding pleuro-pneumonia, did not
have a much better opinion of the vets and
commissioners than your correspondent, B.
F. J., seems to have. They said to an official:
“Yes, sahib, the isolation of cattle gave great
trouble, and the salutries’ hunger was difficult
to appease. When they had left the village,
we got a holy man, who drew a line on
the ground round the herd. Then he got on
horseback and rode round the herd, sprinkling
water and repeating the creed. It was
that which cured the cattle.” What we farmers
want is the isolation and the vets.’ advice,
and if Mr. Allerton and Gen. Singleton have a
“holy man” at command to draw a line
about the infected herds, perhaps we can
get rid of the disease, and thus all parties will
be satisfied.</p>

<h3><a name="Letter_From_Champaign" id="Letter_From_Champaign">Letter From Champaign.</a></h3>


<p>We have now (January 25) had forty days
of snow, and nearly uninterrupted good
sleighing, and the end is not yet&mdash;neither of
snow nor sleighing, for there is fully a foot
of the former now on the ground, and few, if
any, bare spots. But the steady cold is quite
as uncommon as the snow or sleighing, and
will make the winter of 1883-84 a memorable
one. Another remarkable feature is the low
range of the thermometer where mild winters
are thought to be insured by the latitude.
Thus, Central and Southern Kansas and Missouri
have had as cold weather as Central Illinois&mdash;a
good example of which was the 27
degrees below zero registered at Makanda, a
few miles north of Cobden, Ill., while the
lowest point reached, 200 miles further north,
was only a degree or two lower. It may be
winter will break up soon&mdash;and it may be
deeper snows and intenser cold are in store
for us, as in some other winters of great
severity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p>At any rate, the protracted cold and snow
which takes all pasturage out of the account
in carrying stock, is making very heavy
drafts on hay, grain, and fodder of all kinds
and it looks now as if the big hay crop of this
section will be fed out before spring. As for
corn, the most of which is soft and has no
grade and no sale as a merchantable commodity,
except for feeding where it grew&mdash;is
being very lavishly fed to stock of all
kinds, as the most profitable way to get rid
of it. Accounts from Nebraska and Northwest
Kansas report corn in very little better
condition than in Central Illinois, and dealers
who bought and cribbed it early in the season
are reputed badly caught.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p>There is nothing new to report in respect
to the condition of winter wheat. So long as
snow covers the ground it is safe; and after,
it will come through if the weather is warm,
or cold and wet, and there is little freezing
and thawing to thaw it out of the ground.
It is thought by those who have given the
subject some attention, that though the buds
of fruit trees may be killed or badly damaged
by the intense cold, and though the wood was
not thoroughly ripened last year, the ground
not being frozen and the earth being covered
by snow at the time, the vitality of the trees
will remain unimpaired. It is the experience
of Vermont and Maine orchardists, that if
snow falls before the ground freezes to any
considerable depth, apple trees effectually resist
any degree of cold.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The latest contribution of facts going to establish
the new departure in respect to the
location of orchards, comes from a farmer of
Geauga county, Ohio. He writes to the Country
Gentleman of a late date as follows:
“There was little fruit the past season, and
as in many former years, orchards on high
lands bore only a few defective apples. Such
orchards have not borne much for several
years, while orchards on low lands, somewhat
protected, have borne large crops of fair fruit.
My orchards on low land, protected by evergreens,
have brought me several hundred dollars
a year for several years, while the orchards
on high lands, a little west, have not
borne enough for family use for some years.”
Who will tell <span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span> about
the many orchards of Livingston county, Ill.,
which produced, last year, very remarkable
crops of fine apples&mdash;a fact which raised the
value of land in that county several dollars
per acre?</p>

<h3><a name="An_Eloquent_Tribute" id="An_Eloquent_Tribute">An Eloquent Tribute.</a></h3>


<p>The following eloquent tribute to the late
Dr. John A. Warder was written by ex-Gov.
J. Sterling Morton, of Nebraska, chairman of
the memorial committee at the late meeting of
the Mississippi Valley Horticultural Society
at Kansas City. In its estimation of the man
and his work it is appreciative and just: Ingersoll
himself could not surpass it in the
sublimity of its pathos. To be thus commemorated
in the minds and words of men is the
lot of few, and those only who have lived exalted,
useful lives, and whose glowing hearts
have kindled the fires of friendship and love
in the breasts of friends and associates in life’s
cares and labors. Mr. Morton said:</p>

<p>As guests register their names at a hotel,
depart, and are forgotten, so humanity, stopping
for a short time on the earth, makes its
autograph upon the age and sets out upon its
returnless journey to that realm whence come
neither tidings nor greetings.</p>

<p>Each individual of the race leaves some
trace of his existence on the generation in
which he lives, and considerable numbers
transmit their names to posterity italicised in
good deeds or embalmed in noble and elevating
thought.</p>

<p>The desire to be remembered and esteemed
by those who come after us, seems to be, with
the better and more exalted minds, a greater
inspiration to high intellectual effort than the
mere plaudits of cotemporaries. As on the
stage, those actors who play best their parts
are recalled and applauded after the curtain
has fallen, so those in the brief drama of life,
who have best performed their duties are,
after their mortal costumes have been forever
laid away in restful graves, again called out
by their admiring cotemporaries, and thus
their intellectual and moral personalities reappear
before the lights, amidst tumultuous
and emulative applause.</p>

<p>It is the duty and pleasure of your committee,
gentlemen of the Mississippi Valley Horticultural
Society, in harmony with this line
of reflection, to bring before you the character
and services of the recently deceased Dr.
John A. Warder, of Ohio. His naturally
strong mental faculties were led out and
trained, in school and college, to a full and
vigorous stature. His chosen profession of
medicine, in the earlier years of his manhood,
occupied his entire thought and stimulated
him to untiring labor of mind and body, and,
at the same time, gave him also that culture
of the heart which, through his refined, emotional
nature, was ever incarnating itself in
delicate acts of kindness and generosity toward
those who needed sympathy or friends.</p>

<p>But he turned at last from his professional
studies&mdash;from the books in his library&mdash;to
those broader investigations of the mysteries
of life and growth of flowers, fruits and forests,
to which the fields, orchards, and wild
woods of Ohio ever allured him. His childhood
and youth had passed amidst the rustic
scenes of a home in the country, on a farm;
and as the seashell, though ever so long and
far away from its home in the surf, will,
when placed to the ear always moan of its
ocean home, so his great and tender soul ever
yearned for a life among the flora and sylvia
of youth. His brave and benignant spirit
explored all avenues of knowledge which led
into flowering fields and orchards. To his
eye every blossom was a poem; to his quick
perception every tree a book full of useful
and agreeable teachings. And to the study
of these volumes&mdash;these continued annuals&mdash;fresh
in new binding, embellishment, and
gilding every summer and autumn, Dr. Warder
devoted the choicest years of his mature
manhood.</p>

<p>It is the enthusiast of a cause who gives
vitality and propulsive power. Dr. Warder
was an enthusiast in horticulture and in forestry.
To advance the race in those two
vocations no labor was too great for him to
undertake, no sacrifice too severe for him
joyfully to make. At his own expense he
went into fresh territories and States, preaching,
as a missionary of a new gospel, the
importance and necessity of orcharding and
tree planting. His thoughts were strewn,
like precious seeds, among the dwellers on
the prairies of Nebraska, Dakota, Wyoming,
Minnesota and the Northwest. And they
took root, so that the concepts of thousands
of groves and orchards, which now stand as
living monuments to his useful life, came
from his own philanthropic brain. In his
mind miniature forests grew on every prairie,
and golden fruit flashed in the autumn sunlight
of every hill-side. He knew no limit to
his love of horticulture and arboriculture.
He was earnest; he was active, sincere, and
his vitægraph is written wherever flowers
bloom, fruits ripen, and forests wave all over
the country he loved so well and served so
modestly, efficiently, and faithfully.</p>

<p>His example is worthy of the emulation of
our sons and of their sons. And standing at
his grave it is meet and proper for this society
to recall his noble services to its cause, to
wish that, with each recurring year his
memory may, like the flowers and foliage he
studied so well, be clothed in new verdure
and its fragrance perpetuated as a grateful
perfume.</p>

<p>Resolved&mdash;That the Mississippi Valley
Horticultural Society deplores the death of
its friend and active member, Dr. John A.
Warder of Ohio; that our sincere condolence
is extended to his family, and that we recommend
to kindred societies throughout the
Northwest the planting of memorial trees
and groves to commemorate his labors, his
achievements, and his philanthropy as a
skilled orchardist and forester.</p>

<p>were squatters of the lowest class living
in hovels. The construction of the Central
Park, and the opening of the streets in
its neighborhood, changed the whole character
of the surrounding region. In the ten
years succeeding the commencement of work
upon the park, the increased valuation of
taxable property in the wards immediately
adjacent was no less than fifty-four millions
of dollars, affording a surplus of three millions
after paying the interest on all the city
bonds issued for the purchase and construction
of the park, a sum sufficient if used as a
sinking fund to pay the entire principal and
interest of the cost of the park in less time
than was required for its construction.</p>

<p>A similar instance of the profitable conversion
of a deserted and forbidding region into
a rich and elegant quarter of a city, is afforded
by the Park des Butte Chaumont in Paris.</p>

<p>It occupies the site of old abandoned slate
quarries, the precipitous walls and rough excavations
of which have been converted into
picturesque scenery by judicious treatment
and tasteful planting, so as to give it the appearance
of a wild mountain gorge. The result
has been that its vicinity has become a
rich and elegant quarter, simply because it
has been made attractive to the large and
constantly growing class who are seeking
pleasant residence sites within easy access of
their places of business.</p>

<p>These illustrations will suffice to prove the
truth of my assertion, that the objects of
most essential importance to a city in the
creation of a park will be attained by selecting
for its location a site which is naturally
undesirable or even repulsive and converting
it into an attractive quarter, rather than
one which combines all the elements of beauty
and health, and as a consequence is so desirable
for residences, that it can only be had
at great cost.</p>


<p>The Illinois State Dairymen’s Association
will hold its next annual meeting at Champaign,
December 17-19, 1884. Champaign
County Agricultural Society has adopted a
resolution, pledging aid in getting up a first-class
meeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Fanny Field</span>&mdash;Please be kind
enough to tell me what ails the pullets?
We have fifty or sixty spring pullets hatched
in April and May, from which by this time
we expected to get eggs plentifully, and it
stretches our patience to get only from one
to five eggs per day. They have an underground
room with only the front exposed,
well lighted, and we have fed them till they
are fat.</p>

<p>We feed them a warm breakfast of potatoes
and bran, or oats ground, with a little pepper
occasionally, then an hour or two later oats,
and again at night oats or corn, about three
times a week. Plaster, coal, and gravel are
liberally supplied. They have milk and now
and then powdered bones, or refuse meat,
cooked.</p>

<p>By an accident a fine one of over four pounds’
weight was killed, and I had supposed she
ought to lay as she was one of my earliest, but
on investigation I found eggs from a hickory
nut down to shot eggs, that were black or
dark and hard, and I readily conjectured if
the rest were like her it was not strange we
had no eggs. Please tell us the cause and
cure.</p>

<p>Our fowls are mixed, light and dark Brahmas,
Leghorns and everything you would get
by changing eggs with the neighbors. We
have added Plymouth Rocks of late, having
more of them than any other. We save the
best Rock roosters each year. It is the more
surprising as our fowls usually lay well.</p>

<p>Please help us if you can, and oblige a subscriber.</p>

<h3><a name="That_Duck_Farm" id="That_Duck_Farm">That Duck Farm.</a></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Fanny Field</span>&mdash;I have often
thought I would write you through our dear
old <span class="smcap">Prairie Farmer</span>, but the old thief, procrastination,
stole my time. But reading your
description of “A Duck Farm” aroused all
the ambition I have, and the editor willing (I
not being one of the number knowing your
private address) would like to ask a few questions
I consider “necessary,” and will promise
to abide by the terms given in “Chats
with Correspondents” of January 5th, as near
as possible.</p>

<p>I don’t wonder the woman owning the
“duck farm” wished to withhold her name
and whereabouts from the public generally,
besides guarding her pen with “well-trained
dogs” if she has ducks she can induce to lay
125 or even 100 eggs per season, nine and one
third of which will hatch out ducklings that
will all live to be grown ducks.</p>

<p>Take an average of 113 and the ducks will
lay 1,808 eggs per season, and she sells $100
worth at $3 per doz. making 400; then she
sends 24 doz. to New York, then raises “1,100
ducks on the place,” making in all, 1,788,
which, taken from the 1,808 leaves 20 eggs for
non-hatchers and dead ducklings. This I
call pretty close work.</p>

<p>I have had some little experience with
ducks, and I can only get them to lay from
sixty to seventy eggs per season, and about
one eighth of the eggs don’t hatch (from various
causes) and about the same amount of
ducklings die. Now if you will be kind
enough to reveal the woman’s whereabouts to
me I would like to invest if she will warrant
them to come up to your figures; also, is the
said woman a widow?</p>

<p>Now Miss Fanny (if such you are) please
excuse my familiarity. As I have perused
your writings with such pleasure, I feel well
acquainted, so strike me as hard as you please,
but remember there is a hereafter. I have
several facts in regard to my fowls for another
time providing I gain admission.</p>

<p>Eggs are worth thirty-three cents per dozen
here. The hens are not laying nearly as
many as they were at this time last year.
Can any one tell the reason? Farmers ought
to pay more attention to the hens. They do
pay, and pay big if properly cared for. Give
them hot feed in the morning, consisting of
bran, corn meal, beef scraps, a little salt and
a little cayenne pepper. Don’t make them
drink ice water these cold days. Give them
wheat and oats at noon, and whole corn at
night. The warmer your house is the more
profit you will reap. I don’t care whether
your fowls are pure bloods or not, if you take
good care of them they will give you eggs.
A good neighbor of mine says that his pure
Plymouth Rocks do not lay as many eggs as
his common “old fashioned” fowls.</p>

<h3><a name="Corn-Silk_Protection" id="Corn-Silk_Protection">Corn-Silk Protection.</a></h3>


<p>A correspondent of “Gleanings” writes: I
winter on the summer stands, and pack them
a little differently from most persons. I spread
the combs so that eight or nine will fill same
space occupied in summer by ten. Then
placing sticks crosswise of the frames, to allow
a passway for the bees, I spread a cloth
above them, and pack on the top of this two
or three inches of corn-silks. For packing,
these are superior to anything I have yet
seen or heard of. They are clean, and excellent
non-conductors, and will more readily
absorb the moisture than either chaff or saw-dust,
and yet remain perfectly dry. They are
easily collected by a boy when men are husking
in the fields; and when taken off in the
spring can be stored away for another winter.
Knowing the value of them by experience,
I hope that many of our brother bee-keepers
will give them a fair trial.</p>

<h3><a name="Feeding_Back" id="Feeding_Back">Feeding Back.</a></h3>


<p>The question of “feeding back” honey to
bees was discussed at the Michigan State Convention
at Flint. W. Z. Hutchinson had had
a poor season; but as he had mentioned incidentally
that he had practiced “feeding back,”
it brought down upon him a shower of questions.
In feeding back 1,000 pounds of extracted
honey, he had received 800 pounds of
comb honey. Had tiered up the cases of sections
until they were three or four cases high.
Had fed the honey as fast as they would take
it. Looked the sections over about once a
week, and removed the full ones. Some colonies
did much better work than others. After
the first trial, selected the best. No honey
was coming in at the time of the feeding; did
not weigh the hives; weighed only the sections
and the amount. He had a friend who
had fed back upon exactly the same plan,
but his friend had not found it profitable.
He thought that to know just how to feed
back, at a profit, was not yet positively
known.</p>

<p>D. A. Jones: The question of feeding back
has but few advocates, for the reason that
the majority have failed to make it profitable.
To be successful in feeding back there must
be no place in the hive in which the bees can
store honey, except in the sections. Those
hives must be selected that contain the most
honey, or else those having but few combs. My
plan of feeding is to elevate the hives in front
and pour the feed in upon the bottom-board.
The bees do not carry the honey out of the
hives; they must store it somewhere. Bee-keepers
fail to make it pay, because the bees
had an empty brood-chamber. Section boxes
filled with foundation had been given a colony
at 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. M.</span>; feeding commenced, and the
next day, at evening, the bees had commenced
capping some of the sections. Fifty-two
pounds of honey was fed, and forty-four
pounds of comb honey obtained. To get unfinished
sections filled, and at the same time
have the honey removed from some other
unfinished sections, I put the sections that I
wish emptied, over the hive, and the ones
that I wish finished, in the main body of the
hive, keeping the queen out of them by using
perforated zinc.</p>

<p>W. Z. Hutchinson: Will not pouring in
honey at the entrances excite robbing?</p>

<p>D. A. Jones: I do not pour it in at the entrance.
I pour it down inside the hive at the
back.</p>

<p>W. Z. Hutchinson: You speak of using
perforated zinc. I should like to know something
about that. Do the bees work through
it freely? Is there any objection to its use,
except its cost? And where is the expense?
Is it in the material, or in the preparations?</p>

<p>D. A. Jones: It is in no way detrimental.
The bees work through it freely. I see no
objection to its use except its cost, and its
cost is the preparations. Tin would be no
cheaper, for the reason that it comes in smaller
sheets, and the waste would be greater.</p>

<p>W. Z. Hutchinson: I have used honey
boards the past season made of wood, the
slats of which were 5-32 of an inch apart, and
they answered every purpose; and are cheaper
than zinc.</p>

<p>S. T. Pettitt: I can hardly think the wooden
boards would be better than the zinc. It
would take some time to make them, while
the zinc is all ready, and so lasting.</p>

<p>W. Z. Hutchinson: The wood boards cost
only a third as much as the zinc and I prefer
them.</p>

<h3><a name="Bee_Pasturage" id="Bee_Pasturage">Bee Pasturage.</a></h3>


<p>At the late Nebraska Bee-keepers’ Convention
Mr. Ballard spoke very highly of dandelion
and alsike clover, stating that he had
seen four or five bees on one blossom of dandelion,
and recommends alsike clover, as it
will take root on the prairie.</p>

<p>G. M. Cooper, Beatrice, gave it as his opinion
that white clover did not secrete any honey
last spring, on account of the cool weather.</p>

<p>P. M. Aldrich said that his bees worked on
rape long after frost. No one present had
ever seen rape fail.</p>

<p>Mr. Colwell sowed the roadside twice last
year, and had a continuous bloom all summer,
and late in the fall; puts one peck to the
acre on the roadside.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawley sows about six pounds of rape
seed per acre.</p>

<p>Mr. Colwell’s bees have a great feast on box
elder sap, early in spring.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawley has sown rape several times,
but the bees only gathered fast enough to
build up; he can tell when his bees are gathering
rape honey, by the odor.</p>

<p>C. C. Turney, Ceresco, had seen bees work
very extensively on the blackberry, both blossom
and fruit, and also on parsley.</p>

<p>Wm. Sutton, Elk Creek, saw his bees on
raspberry and alsike clover; they did a great
deal to stimulate his bees, although the quantity
is limited in his locality; they bloom
about the middle of June.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ancient Egyptians of the Nile had floating
bee-houses, designed to take advantage of
the honey harvest. They were warned when
it was time to return home by the depth to
which the boat sank in the water under the
weight of the cargo of honey. That the bees
might not be lost, they were obliged to journey
during the night-time.</p>

<h3>The Brilliant Sunsets.</h3>


<p>Few of our readers, probably, have failed
to note the fact that brilliant sunsets have
been unusually frequent since the latter part
of November. Now a highly colored sunset
is not, in itself, a remarkable phenomenon,
and it may occur at any time of the year, and
owe its origin to any one of several causes,
very simple in themselves, as refraction by
the atmosphere of the sun’s rays, which are
thrown upon the sky after the orb itself has
passed from sight, or a peculiarly humid condition
of the upper air, or a remarkable electric
condition, such as sometimes precedes a
thunder storm. But the late brilliant sunsets
do not belong to the category of ordinary phenomena.
In the first place, they have not
shown gorgeously hued clouds, as in usual
sunset displays, but skies of dazzling tints
and colors. In the second place, they have
been prolonged for weeks, and have been seen,
at intervals, over nearly every part of the
globe. Evidently, some unusual circumstance
must have given rise to these unwonted phenomena,
and scientists in both hemispheres
have been interested in seeking an answer to
the problem. As it seemed very plain that
no condition of humidity could account for
such remarkable refraction, it was universally
concluded that some substance, as dust,
must exist in the upper air regions. This being
accepted as probable another theory was
needed to account for the presence of this
dust. The first theory put forward by scientists
in this country suggested the hypothesis
of meteoric dust.</p>

<p>Meteors are gaseous bodies, which move
through space in immense numbers, and in
definite orbits. Drawn astray from these orbits
by the attraction of the earth, they are set
on fire on contact with the atmosphere, this
ignition producing the phenomena of shooting
stars. The product of this combustion is
sometimes heavy enough as to fall rapidly, in
the shape of stones, to the earth. More often
it is an impalpable substance, which filters
slowly down through the air, and is found in
the shape of metallic dust, on the summits of
snow-covered mountains and in the Arctic
regions. About the middle of November the
earth passes through a meteor zone&mdash;that is,
an immense swarm of meteors revolving
around the sun&mdash;and during this month there
are always vastly more shooting stars to be
seen than in any other month of the year. The
brilliant sunsets being first seen in the latter
part of November, their near coincidence in
time with an unusual display of brilliant
meteors, seemed to substantiate the theory
that they were of similar origin. It is known
that the telescope reveals immense numbers
of these meteors too small to be seen by the
naked eye, and it seems very probable that
millions more are too small to be seen even
with the telescope, mere meteoric dust that
can only announce its presence to the eye by
its refraction of the sun’s rays as they pass
through it. When this dust falls it becomes
visible otherwise, perhaps. We have spoken
of its appearance on snow-covered hills. Sometimes
it appears as a haze or dry fog. At least
the appearance of any very remarkable haze,
like that which obscured the light of the sun
for weeks over Europe, in 1783, is now
ascribed by science to the dust of enormous
falls of meteors.</p>

<p>Had this theory of the cause of the bright
sunsets been the true one, however, there
should have been unusual displays of shooting
stars visible as soon as darkness came on
after the sunsets, for meteors are always ignited
by the friction of the earth’s atmosphere.
As these were not seen, the meteoric dust
theory did not gain a very general support,
and the opinion of many scientific men was
that we must wait for a more probable theory.
When it came to be known that these remarkable
appearances of color in the sky had
been visible from different points of the
earth’s surface ever since last September, a
theory was offered by Prof. Lockyer, the well-known
English astronomer, and the editor of
Nature, a leading scientific periodical, which
is now generally accepted as solving the
problem.</p>

<p>Mr. Lockyer thinks that these remarkable
sunset glows are the late, but direct effects of
the great volcanic eruptions which occurred
in Java, last August. He believes that the
enormous volumes of fine volcanic dust thrown
out by these eruptions were carried into the
upper air, and being borne by prevailing
winds around and above the earth, the reflection
of the sun’s rays upon them have produced
the phenomena witnessed at so many
different points.</p>

<p>The adequacy of this supposed cause seems
plain, when we remember what a mighty convulsion
of nature occurred at Java. Earthquake
and eruptions followed one another
with such force that they were felt for hundreds
of miles distant. Large islands sunk
from sight and new land appeared and the
entire conformation of the Archipelago in that
locality was changed. The great volumes of
mud thrown out of the volcano Krakatoa fell
in showers for over three hours in localities
more than thirty miles away. With volcanic
forces at work on this mighty scale, millions
of tons of earth must have been hurled into
the upper air. Of this the coarse and heavy
material would naturally fall at once, but
vast clouds of impalpable dust would be borne
upward by the heated air, until they reached
the region of the upper trade-winds, by which
they would be borne westward in the circuit
of the globe. Each evening these immense
dust clouds would give a novel brilliancy to
the skies, by reflecting the light of the setting
sun, and during the day an unusual hazy appearance
of the sky would probably be perceived.</p>

<p>This hypothesis of Mr. Lockyer was remarkably
borne out by facts that actually occurred.
The Java eruptions occurred August
26 and 27. On August 28, from the islands in
the Indian Sea, near the African coast, Mauritias,
Rodriguez, and the Seychelles, very
singular sunsets and sunrises were observed,
though not directly resembling those seen
later, and a strange haze appeared, through
which the sun seemed to be white and dim as
the moon. On August 31, in the same latitude
as these islands, in North Brazil, remarkable
sunlight effects were observed, the sun appearing
of a deep blue tint; the next evening
similar appearances were seen in Venezuela.
On September 1, also, a remarkable sunset
was reported visible from the Gulf Coast,
and one from Trinidad, Spain, at the same
date. September 5, another was seen near
Honolulu, in the Pacific ocean. This line of
strange sunsets ran directly east and west.
Another line ran from southeast to northwest,
beginning with Ceylon and Madras and
ending with England. Following this, the
phenomena seemed to spread themselves over
the whole portion of the earth’s surface, appearing
at various points during four whole
months. The points of difference between
the earlier and later appearances were closely
defined by Mr. Lockyer. At first the coarse
particles suspended in the air obscured the
sun’s light entirely, as was the case in the
neighborhood of Java immediately following
the earthquake. These disappearing, the sun
seemed white and dim; the dust being still
more thinned out, the blue and red molecules
caused the appearance of a blue sun, and at
last there was just enough of the finest dust
left suspended to be carried by the various
wind currents hither and thither and produce
at the time of the setting of the sun, those
singular reflected lights, which, at first almost
unnoticed, became, when observed, the
wonder of the world.</p>

<p>It may be admitted that there are gaps in
the evidence supporting this last hypothesis,
but it has the merit of probability, and must
be accepted as the best theory of the brilliant
sunsets yet offered.</p>

<p class="center">Author of “<i>Walks and Talks on the Farm</i>,” “<i>Farm
Crops</i>,” “<i>Harris on the Pig</i>,” <i>etc</i>.</p>


<p>While we have no lack of treatises upon artificial fertilizers,
there is no work in which the main stay of the
farm&mdash;the manure made upon the farm&mdash;is treated so
satisfactorily or thoroughly as in this volume. Starting
with the question,</p>

<p class="center">
<b>“WHAT IS MANURE?”</b>
</p>

<p>the author, well known on both sides of the water by his
writings, runs through in sufficient detail every source
of manure on the farm, discussing the methods of making
rich manure; the proper keeping and applying it,
and especially the</p>

<p class="center">
<b>USES OF MANURE,</b>
</p>

<p>and the effects of different artificial fertilizers, as compared
with farm-yard manure, upon different crops. In
this he makes free use of the striking series of experiments
instituted years ago, and still continued, by Lawes
and Gilbert, of Rothamsted, England. The</p>

<p class="center">
<b>REMARKABLE TABLES</b>
</p>

<p>in which the results of these experiments are given, are
here for the first time made accessible to the American
farmer. In fact, there is scarcely any point relating to
fertilizing the soil, including suitable manures for special
crops, that is not treated, and while the teachings are
founded upon the most elaborate scientific researches,
they are so far divested of the technical language of
science as to commend themselves to farmers as eminently
“practical.” It is not often that the results of
scientific investigations are presented in a manner so
thoroughly popular. 12mo. Price, postpaid, $1.50.</p>

<h3><a name="Pyramidal_Women" id="Pyramidal_Women">Pyramidal Women.</a></h3>


<p>It has long been a social mystery, over
which conservatives and radicals have puzzled
alike, why the gifted men and women of
our race should spring almost exclusively
from the intermediate ranks of life. The solution
is found in Piazzi Smyth’s metaphor of
the Great Pyramid. A circumscribed routine
of pleasure on one hand, of toil on the
other, equally engrosses the time and thoughts
of the dwellers at either end. It is only in
the middle of the pyramid that one is free to
live up to the standard of the hideless coffer,
the sarcophagus measure, the measure of a
man!</p>

<p>Of the feminine attainers to this measure,
says a writer in the American Queen, the
women who are taking up their lives and
living them fully in all their length and
breadth and dignity, as lives must be lived to
reach the cosmic standard of the pyramidal
man, there is found one pre-eminent type in
that woman of letters against whom a hard
battle is being waged to-day.</p>

<p>To woman emancipated, freed from veil
and harem, elevated from her primal position
when she was but the toy and tool of man’s
passion, this age of civilization points with a
pride whose justifiableness has yet to be
proved. Exterior liberty she has gained indeed;
but in the face of the fact that this universal
crusade against women of letters is
but the determination to hold the old shackles
on heart and brain, what is her alleged
emancipation but a lengthening of the chain
which still binds her in moral and mental
bondage.</p>

<p>“The shrieking sisterhood,” be it said in
justice to the sex, represent a small minority.
Few and far between are the women who
would usurp man’s place on platform or at
poll; still fewer and farther apart the advocate
of woman’s right to drop her petticoat
for the untrammeled freedom of the trousers.
But the great-hearted woman, yearning for
recognition as paramount forces of social
regeneration&mdash;the great-minded women taking
up the problems of life and grappling with
them for the sake of their weaker sisters&mdash;these
are many, confined and silenced within
the gilded bars which society is daily drawing
closer and stronger about them. This
narrowing of woman’s sphere, this withholding
her from anything but a mission
purely physical, is but a different form of the
old barbarism whose alleged destruction is
the boast of the present day; and the time is
not far distant when the wrong must be acknowledged
and amended, or retrogression
brand the age for which we so proudly claim
progression! Let the hackneyed cry of woman’s
intellectual inferiority prove its truth,
conclusively, as it has not yet been proved, or
let it be silenced forever! The cranial differences
existent between the sexes, upon which
the theoristic foundation of their respective
superiority and inferiority of intellect has
been laid, are, in truth, the exponents of sexual
intellectual equality, science having proclaimed
them the visible proofs of that mutual
dependence and adaptability which, sexually,
mind has for mind, as body for body.
Let this truth be no longer denied; let present
social theories hold their sway, and in a
generation of pigmies, moral, mental, and
physical, our race, in all its glorious potentialities,
must sink ignominiously into
oblivion. This is an important fact,
of which society seems to have lost sight&mdash;that
upon the women of to-day and of to-morrow
the coming man is wholly dependent,
type being the transmitter of type, according
to its kind. The increase of female education
has naturally awakened women to a recognition
of all her latent intellectual possibilities,
and hence the growth of feminine
ranks in that wide field whose battles are
fought with a weapon “mightier than the
sword.” The recruits of to-day are not all
Mrs. Brownings nor George Eliots, but the
world will lose infinitely in good and strength
and sweetness if the budding Adelaide Proctors
and Mrs. Burnetts are blighted by the
propagation of that harsh masculine doctrine
which, stripped of its pretty sophisms, is resolved
into the bare assertion that a woman
of talent is a woman unsexed! This doctrine,
false, shallow, and unjust, is the enemy with
whom woman is battling to-day.</p>

<p>May the pyramidal prophecy soon be verified
when “all things shall be compared in
pure truth and righteousness.” Then the conflict
shall be ended and the intellectual
growth of woman be revealed, the heightener,
enricher, purifier of that emotional development
which is the essence of ideal womanhood&mdash;an
essence thrilling as deeply and tenderly
the hearts of the humble followers in
her footsteps as it thrilled the hearts of that
greatest of woman poets, who sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">What art can a woman be good at? Oh, vain!</div>
<div class="verse">What art is she good at but hurting her breast</div>
<div class="verse">With the milk-teeth of babes and a smile at her pain?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>pointing in the zenith of her fame to the divine
right of maternity as the supreme, holiest
and sweetest potentiality of womanhood.</p>

<h3><a name="Give_the_Babies_Water" id="Give_the_Babies_Water">Give the Babies Water.</a></h3>


<p>A recent editorial article in the New York
Medical Record contains the following pertinent
remarks on the value of water in the
treatment of sick infants:</p>

<p>“With the exception of tuberculosis, no disease
is so fatal in infancy as intestinal catarrh
occurring especially during the hot summer
months, and caused, in the majority of cases,
by improper diet. There are many upon
whom the idea does not seem to have impressed
itself, that an infant can be thirsty
without, at the same time, being hungry.
When milk, the chief food of infants, is given
in excess, acid fermentation results, causing
vomiting, diarrhœa, with passage of green or
yellowish-green stools, elevated temperature,
and the subsequent train of symptoms which
are too familiar to need repetition. The same
thing would occur in the adult, if drenched
with milk. The infant needs no food, but
drink. The recommendation of some writers,
that barley-water or gum-water be given to
the little patients in these cases, is sufficient
explanation of their want of success in treating
this affection. Pure water is perfectly
innocuous to infants, and it is difficult to conceive
how the seeming prejudice to it ever
arose. Any one who has ever noticed the
avidity with which a fretful sick infant drinks
water, and marks the early abatement of febrile
and other symptoms, will be convinced
that water, as a beverage, a quencher of thirst,
a physiological necessity, in fact, should not
be denied to the helpless member of society.
We have often seen an infant which had been
dosed ad nauseam for gastro-intestinal irritability,
assume, almost at once, a more cheerful
appearance, and rapidly grow better, when
treated to the much-needed draught of water.
If any prescription is valuable enough to be
used as routine practice, it is, ‘Give the
babies water.’”</p>

<p>To make a pretty little pitcher, cut off the
small end of an egg, then carefully remove
the yolk and white of the egg; next take a
narrow strip of colored paper and paste it
around the edge of the opening, making the
paper pinked in one place so as to look like
the mouth of a pitcher. Then paste a strip
around the other end of the egg so that it will
stand alone; to finish the pitcher paste on a
strip of paper bent in the shape of a handle.
Cups may be made in the same manner by
cutting away more of the shell than would
be cut in making a pitcher. Pretty air castles
are made by cutting egg shells in half,
building the cut edges with colored paper or
cloth, and fastening to them bright colored
cord or silk by which to suspend them. These
air castles look pretty when suspended from
brackets, hanging lamps, etc. The pitchers,
cups and air-castles may be improved by being
ornamented with small pictures pasted on
them.</p>

<h3><a name="A_Chat_About_Halifax" id="A_Chat_About_Halifax">A Chat About Halifax.</a></h3>


<p>As I promised you I will try and tell you a
little about Halifax.</p>

<p>Halifax is, as you all know, the capital of
Nova Scotia, which is one of the provinces of
British North America, and thus is under the
dominion of the Queen. It is just what I
should imagine a real old English city to be&mdash;very
odd and antiquated, and yet picturesquely
beautiful, and altogether a most
charming place in which to spend a summer.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the stroll I took alone
the second morning after my arrival. The
day was one of those rarely perfect ones in
July. All nature seemed wrapped in a
dreamy repose; the heat of the sun was tempered
by the soft sea breezes blowing from
the grand old ocean not many leagues away,
whose roar sounded like the voice of many
waters, soothing, restful, and sweet.</p>

<p>It happened that my wanderings led me in
to some of the older portions of the city
where the houses are many of them two hundred
years old. And such funny, queer old
houses. They seemed, somehow, to have a
slanting look to them; it may have been,
however, that it was because the streets were
so hilly, and such a contrast to our flat, level
prairies.</p>

<p>Right in the midst of the city, among the
stores (shops they call them) and houses one
comes suddenly upon the graveyards&mdash;some
of them not now in use, but still left there.
What interested me was the flat tombstones.
When a little girl my father used to tell me
of how the children would take their dolls
to the cemetery and play upon and under the
grave stones. Do I hear you exclaim, “What,
play <i>under</i> a grave stone!” I do not wonder,
for it seemed a funny thing to me, but it was
quite clear when I saw how the marble slabs
were placed. Instead of standing in an upright
position, as you have always seen them,
they were laid flat and raised some distance
from the ground (high enough for a child to
crawl under comfortably) by means of little
marble posts. I used often to roam through
these cemeteries with a dear old gentleman
who would tell me stories of the brave young
sailor boys buried there, far away from their
own loved English homes.</p>

<p>Halifax is one of the most strongly fortified
cities in America, and at every turn one
meets the red coated soldiers in the streets&mdash;when
they are not on duty. What would interest
our boys would be to see a sham battle;
the officers and soldiers all in uniform, eager
and active as for a real encounter with the
enemy.</p>

<p>One day I went to visit the strongest fort
the city contains. It is called Citadel Hill,
and overlooks and commands the harbor;
which by the way, is considered one of the
finest in the world. This Citadel is merely an
immense hill, covering nearly half a mile of
ground and situated in the very heart of the
city. When you have climbed to the top you
come upon a large opening, and looking down
see a long flight of iron steps leading to the
ground, many, many feet below. The hill is
excavated and stored with arms and ammunition
of all kinds, and great cannons, that
look so cruel. All along the outer edge of
this excavation were little rooms in which
the married soldiers lived with their families.
I pitied the little children that had to live in
this way, without any home feeling&mdash;never
knowing at what moment their father might
be called away, for a soldier’s life is necessarily
a roving one.</p>

<p>This hill would make a grand coasting
place in the winter, and one which I have no
doubt the little Blue Nose boys and girls often
avail themselves of. In Halifax not only the
boys and girls, but the men and women also,
make much more of winter sports than we
do. The large and elegant skating rink I
hear has just been opened and, the regimental
band have given a grand concert in honor
of the occasion.</p>

<p>Snow-shoeing used to be indulged in largely,
but in the city the custom is, I believe, somewhat
falling off. I do not think you Western
boys and girls could hardly imagine what
odd, pretty suits the girls make to go skating
and snow-shoeing in. The one I saw was
made of two large white flannel bed-blankets,
with a bright scarlet and blue border. The
suit consisted of a skirt, circular-like cloak,
and cap with a long side flap to it, which
hung nearly to the shoulder. My cousin
dressed herself all up in her pretty rig and
then got down her wooden snow-shoes and
buckled them on. She looked like a winter
fairy all ready for an Arctic expedition.</p>

<p>I must confess I could hardly understand
how she could manage to walk in the great
unwieldy looking shoes, which were nearly
five times as large as an ordinary shoe, but
she assured me it was great fun and easily
done.</p>

<p>I heard an amusing story there about a
minister who wished to be married, but who
lived a long distance from the neighboring
minister, and the snow was very deep, and
there was but one pair of snow-shoes. Not
wishing to wait until spring he hit upon a
novel plan which was this:</p>

<p>That his ladylove should stand upon the
back of his snow-shoes, clasp her arms tightly
around her future lord’s waist, and thus be
carried safely to the neighboring kirk, which
she accordingly did. You see this required
no real effort on the lady’s part, only, I should
judge, a great deal of pluck and nerve power,
as well as love. However the story is that
they accomplished the journey in safety and
were duly married.</p>

<p>One of the prettiest drives in Halifax can
be had in a place called the park (what we
would call a park proper they call the gardens).
This park, situated in the southern
part of the city and overlooking an arm of
the ocean, has twenty miles of smooth, beautiful
roads winding around, and circling in
and out among the trees. The roads were
made by the soldiers, who received for
their work twenty-five cents a day besides
their regular army pay. There is also
another strong fort in this park. There are, I
think, nine forts, strongly garrisoned in and
about the city.</p>

<p>I wonder if any of <span class="smcap">The Prairie Farmer</span>
boys and girls have the same desire that I had
when living away out West, where I never saw
water, much less a ship, to go through a large
ocean steamship. If you have I hope that
some day you may be able to have your wish
gratified as I had mine.</p>

<p>One morning my friend said, “Will you go
to a concert this afternoon or go and visit the
ships?” “The ships of course,” I cried, and
to the ships we went. The “Scotia” was just
in on her way from Liverpool to New York,
crowded with passengers. It was noon when
we went on board, and the long tables were
being laid out in the salon. Most of the
cabin passengers were out “doing” the city
so we saw only the steerage passengers.
Now I had heard much of the steerage passengers,
but really never imagined them to
be such a poor, miserable looking set of beings.
They sat around almost anywhere
with a plate of soup or a dish full of other
unpalatable appearing food and ate as though
they did not care much whether they lived or
died. I longed to speak to the children and
the downcast looking mothers, but they were
nearly all of foreign birth, and would not
have understood me if I had.</p>

<p>Many of the better class of passengers were
in the little side rooms at their private meals,
but we only caught side glimpses of them
passing through. It was a very pleasant
sensation to sit in the handsome saloon and
almost imagine yourself to be sailing, sailing
away in the great noble ship to the land of
your dreams and fancies.</p>

<p>There are many more things of interest
about this pretty city I would like to touch
upon, but I fear my space is already occupied,
so will have to say good-by for this week.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Little_Legislatures" id="The_Little_Legislatures">The Little Legislatures.</a></h3>


<p>Most of these are in session again over the
land. I do not mean those law-making bodies
which meet annually at the State capitols to
undo what they had done before, or otherwise
make work for the courts and lawyers. But
I allude to those little assemblies of young
folks&mdash;lads and lasses&mdash;that weekly meet in
the winter season in all the thousand and
one school-houses and rural halls throughout
our country. Legislatures did I call them?
Not quite legislatures; but training schools in
which legislators are made; and it is in these
that our rising youth are qualifying themselves
to govern the country that is so soon to
be theirs.</p>

<p>Little as we may think of it, these assemblies,
under whatever name they may be
known&mdash;lyceums, societies, clubs, or “legislatures,”&mdash;are
a power in the land; they do
far more than most people think in forming
the characters and fixing the opinions of the
great multitude of boys and girls who participate
in them. They are to-day more numerous
than ever before, though they have been
abroad in the land for more than half a century.
Many of the leading actors on the
world’s stage at the present day owe their position
to the influence of one or more of these
little associations of which they formed a
part in their boyhood days. The writer of
this could not count on his fingers the number
of his associates in boyhood, who have
risen out of these schools to positions of honor
and trust in the country.</p>

<p>But there is a marked feature belonging to
them now that did not exist a half century
ago, the result of a vast change that has been
made in public sentiment within that period.
Then they were confined only to the boys;
now the girls participate in them almost, if
not quite, as freely as their brothers; and it
must be confessed that in a great majority of
cases the result has been beneficial to both
sexes. The fogyism of that day stoutly protested
that hens should not be permitted to
crow, yet they persisted in learning the art,
and conservatism has been forced to acknowledge
that they can crow vociferously and to
good effect. And these institutions have
proven to be good crowing schools to girls.</p>

<p>Let these associations be encouraged in every
school district; but care should be taken
by the elder class that they be properly organized
and conducted in an orderly manner.
Youthful zeal and ardor will be apt to break
out into rudeness and disorder, unless held in
check by the aged and experienced. Let the
older, then, wherever these associations exist,
see to it that they are prudently managed&mdash;else
instead of blessings they will become
evils in the community.</p>

<p>The points to which these efforts should be
mainly directed, should be&mdash;first, plain rules
for their government; second, a strict adherence
to them when adopted; a diversity of
exercises&mdash;not too much debate, and not too
many essays; fourth, the avoidance of all
personal matters; and fifth, a judicious selection
of subjects. With these points held well
in view, and with a serious desire for improvement,
these institutions can not but be
useful; otherwise they should be discontinued.</p>

<p>Farmers everywhere ought to encourage
the formation of these institutions in their respective
neighborhoods, and aid their sons
and daughters in carrying them forward.
Give them your countenance and your
counsel.</p>

<h3><a name="Walking_Canes" id="Walking_Canes">Walking Canes.</a></h3>


<p>The material of which walking sticks are
made is as various as can well-nigh be conceived
of. Many are imported woods&mdash;some
from the tropics, China and the East Indies.
The celebrated Whongee canes are from
China, where they are well known and celebrated
for the regularity of their joints, which
are the points from which the leaves are given
off, and the stems of a species of phyllosiachys,
a gigantic grass, closely allied to the
bamboo. The orange and lemon are highly
prized, and are imported chiefly from the
West Indies, and perfect specimens command
enormous prices. The orange stick is known
by its beautiful green bark, with fine white
longitudinal markings, and the lemon by the
symmetry of its proportions, and both prominence
and regularity of its knobs. Myrtle
sticks also possess a value, since their appearance
is so peculiar that their owner would
seldom fail to recognize them. They are imported
from Algeria. The rajah stick is an
importation. It is the stem of a plant and a
species of calamus. It is grown in Borneo,
and takes its name from the fact that the
Rajah will not allow any to go out of the
country unless a heavy duty is paid. These
canes, known as palm canes, are distinguished
by an angular and more or less flat appearance.
Their color is brownish, spotted, and
they are quite straight, with neither knob
nor curl. They are the petioles of leaf stalk
of the date palm. Perhaps the most celebrated
of the foreign canes are the Malacca,
being the stems of the calamus sceptonum, a
slender climbing palm, and not growing
around Malacca, as the name would seem to
indicate, but imported from Stak, on the opposite
coast of Sumatra. Other foreign canes
are ebony, rosewood, partridge or hairwood,
and cactus, which, when the pith is cut out,
presents a most novel appearance, hollow and
full of holes.</p>

<p><a id="young_folk_items"></a><span class="smcap">Shortly</span> after Miss Alcott’s “Little Women”
was published a quiet-looking lady entered
a Boston circulating library and asked
a lady clerk to pick her out “a good book that
would rest and amuse her.” Naturally “Little
Women” was offered, and declined. “It’s
very nice; you’d like it,” urged the clerk. “I
should not care to read it,” said the other.
“But at least look at it.” “No,” came the answer,
firmly and with an odd smile; “it is
not a book that I should care to read.” Then
the clerk, pretty angry, walked away to the
chief librarian and cried: “There’s a woman
down there wants a book, and if you want
her waited on somebody else must do it. I
won’t.” “Why, why not?” “Why, she says
‘Little Women’ isn’t good enough for her to
read.” “Do you know who that lady is?”
“No, and I don’t care.” “Well, I’ll tell you.
That is Louise M. Alcott. Now go and get
her a book.”</p>

<h3><a name="THE_CURFEW_HEROINE" id="THE_CURFEW_HEROINE">THE CURFEW HEROINE.</a></h3>


<p>The story that is the basis of the well-known
poem, “Curfew Shall Not Ring To-night,”
told in prose is as follows:</p>

<p>It lacked quite half an hour of curfew toll.
The old bell-ringer came from under the
wattled roof of his cottage stoop and stood
with uncovered head in the clear sweet-scented
air. He had grown blind and deaf in the
service, but his arm was as muscular as ever,
and he who listened this day marked no faltering
in the heavy metallic throbs of the
cathedral bell. Old Jasper had lived through
many changes. He had tolled out the notes
of mourning for good Queen Bess, and with
tears scarcely dry he had rung the glad tidings
of the coronation of James. Charles I.
had been crowned, reigned, and expiated his
weakness before all England in Jasper’s time,
and now he who under army held all the
common wealth in the hollow of his hand,
ruled as more than monarch, and still the old
man with the habit of a long life upon him
rang his matin and sorrow.</p>

<p>Jasper stood alone now, lifting his dimmed
eyes up to the softly dappled sky.</p>

<p>The wall of his memory seemed so written
over&mdash;so crossed and recrossed by the annals
of the years that had gone before, that there
seemed little room for anything in the present.
Little recked he that Cromwell’s spearsmen
were camped on the moor beyond the
village&mdash;that Cromwell himself rode with
his guardsmen a league away; he only knew
that the bell had been rung in the tower when
William the Conqueror made curfew a law,
had been spared by Puritan and Roundhead,
and that his arm for sixty years had never
failed him at even-tide.</p>

<p>He was moving with a slow step toward
the gate, when a woman came hurriedly in
from the street and stood beside him; a lovely
woman, but with a face so blanched that
it seemed carved in the whitest of marble,
with all its roundness and dimples. Her
great, solemn eyes were raised to the aged
face in pitiful appeal, and the lips were forming
words that he could not understand.</p>

<p>“Speak up, lass, I am deaf and can not
hear your chatter.”</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, Jasper, do not ring
the curfew bells to-night.”</p>

<p>“What! na ring curfew? You must be daft,
lassie.”</p>

<p>“Jasper, for sweet heaven’s sake&mdash;for my
sake&mdash;for one night in all your long life forget
to ring the bell! Fail this once and my
lover shall live, whom Cromwell says shall
die at curfew toll. Do you hear? my lover,
Richard Temple. See, Jasper, here is my
money to make your old age happy. I sold
my jewelry that the Lady Maud gave me, and
the gold shall be yours for one curfew.”</p>

<p>“Would you bribe me, Lily De Vere?
Ye’re a changeling. Ye’re na the blood of
the Plantagenets in ye’re veins as ye’re mother
had. What, corrupt the bell-ringer under
her majesty, good Queen Bess? Not for all
the gold that Lady Maud could bring me!
Babes have been born and strong men have
died before now at the ringing of my bell.
Awa’! Awa’!”</p>

<p>And out on the village green with the solemn
shadows of the lichens lengthening over
it, a strong man awaited the curfew toll for
his death. He stood handsome, and brave,
and tall&mdash;taller by an inch than the tallest
pikeman who guarded him.</p>

<p>What had he done that he should die? Little
it mattered in those days, when the sword
that the great Cromwell wielded was so prone
to fall, what he or others had done. He had
been scribe to the late lord up at the castle,
and Lady Maud, forgetting that man must
woo and woman must wait, had given her
heart to him without the asking, while the
gentle Lily De Vere, distant kinswoman and
poor companion of her, had, without seeking,
found the treasures of his true love and held
them fast. Then he had joined the army and
made one of the pious soldiers whose evil
passions were never stirred but by sign or
symbol of poetry. But a scorned woman’s
hatred had reached him even there. Enemies
and deep plots had compassed him about and
conquered him. To-night he was to die.</p>

<p>The beautiful world lay as a vivid picture
before him. The dark green wood above the
rocky hill where Robin Hood and his merry
men had dwelt; the frowning castle with its
drawbridge and square towers, the long
stretch of moor with the purple shadows upon
it, the green, straight walks of the village,
the birds overhead, even the daisies at his
feet he saw. But ah! more vividly than all,
he saw the great red sun with its hazy veil
lingering above the trees as though it pitied
him with more than human pity.</p>

<p>He was a God fearing and a God serving
man. He had long made his peace with
heaven. Nothing stood between him and
death&mdash;nothing rose pleadingly between him
and those who were to destroy him but the
sweet face of Lily De Vere, whom he loved.
She had knelt at Cromwell’s feet and pleaded
for his life. She wearied heaven with her
prayers, but all without avail.</p>

<p>Slowly now the great sun went down.
Slowly the last rim was hid beneath the
greenwood. Thirty seconds more and his
soul would be with God. The color did not
forsake his cheeks. The dark rings of hair
lay upon a warm brow. It was his purpose
to die as martyrs and brave men die. What
was life that he should cling to it? He almost
felt the air pulsate with the first heavy
roll of the death knell. But no sound came.
Still facing the soldiers with his clear gray
eyes upon them he waited.</p>

<p>The crimson banners in the west were
paling to pink. The kine had ceased their
lowing, and had been gathered into the rick
yards.</p>

<p>All nature had sounded her curfew, but
old Jasper was silent!</p>

<p>The bell-ringer, with his gray head yet
bared, had traversed half the distance between
his cottage and the ivy-covered tower
when a form went flitting past him, with
pale, shadowy robes floating round it, and
hair that the low western lights touched and
tinted as with a halo.</p>

<p>“Ah, Huldah, Huldah!” the old man muttered;
“how swift she flies? I will come soon
dear. My work is almost done.”</p>

<p>Huldah was the good wife who had gone
from him in her early womanhood, and for
whom he had mourned all his long life. But
the fleeting form was not Huldah’s. It was
Lily De Vere, hurried by a sudden and desperate
purpose toward the cathedral.</p>

<p>“So help me God, curfew shall not ring to-night!
Cromwell and his dragoons come this
way. Once more I will kneel at his feet and
plead.”</p>

<p>She entered the ruined arch. She wrenched
from its fastening the carved and worm-eaten
door that barred the way to the tower.
She ascended with flying and frenzied feet
the steps; her heart lifted up to God for Richard’s
deliverance from peril. The bats flew
out and shook the dust of centuries from the
black carving. As she went up she caught
glimpses of the interior of the great building,
with its groined roof, its chevrons and
clustered columns; its pictured saint and
carved image of the virgin, which the pillages
of ages had been spared to be dealt with
by time, the most relentless vandal of all.</p>

<p>Up&mdash;still&mdash;up&mdash;beyond the rainbow tints
thrown by the stained glass across her death-white
brow; up&mdash;still&mdash;up&mdash;past open arch,
with griffin and gargoyles staring at her from
under bracket and cornice, with all the hideousness
and mediæval carving; the stairs,
flight by flight, growing frailer beneath her
young feet; now but a slender network between
her and the outer world; but still up.</p>

<p>Her breath was coming short and gasping.
She saw through an open space old Jasper
cross the road at the foot of the tower. Oh,
how far! The seconds were treasures which
Cromwell, with all his blood-bought commonwealth,
could not purchase from her. Up&mdash;ah&mdash;there,
just above her with its great brazen
mouth and wicked tongue, the bell hung.
A worm eaten block for a step, and one small
white had clasped itself above the clapper&mdash;the
other prepared, at the tremble, to
rise and clasp its mate, and the feet to swing
off&mdash;and thus she waited. Jasper was old
and slow, but he was sure and it came at
last. A faint quiver, and the young feet
swung from their rest, and the tender hands
clasped for more than their precious life the
writhing thing. There was groaning and
creaking of the rude pulleys above, and then
the strokes came heavy and strong. Jasper’s
hand had not forgot its cunning, nor his arm
its strength. The tender, soft form was
swung and dashed to and fro. But she clung
to and caressed the cold, cruel thing. Let one
stroke come and a thousand might follow&mdash;for
its fatal work would be done. She
wreathed her white arms about it, so that with
every pull of the great rope it crushed into
the flesh. It tore her, and wounded and
bruised; but there in the solemn twilight the
brave woman swung and fought with the
curfew, and God gave her victory.</p>

<p>The old bell-ringer said to himself: “Aye,
Huldah, my work is done. The pulleys are
getting too heavy for my old arms; my ears,
too, have failed me. I dinna hear one stroke
of the curfew. Dear old bell! it is my ears
that have gone false, and not thou. Farewell
old friend.”</p>

<p>And just beyond the worn pavement a
shadowy form again went flitting past him.
There were drops of blood upon the white
garments, and the face was like the face of
one who walked in her sleep, and her hands
hung wounded and powerless at her side.
Cromwell paused with his horsemen under
the dismantled May-pole before the village
green. He saw the man who was to die at
sunset standing up in the dusky air, tall as a
king and beautiful as Absalom. He gazed
with knitted brow and angry eye, but his
lips did not give utterance to the quick command
that trembled on them, for a girl came
flying toward him. Pikeman and archer
stepped aside to let her pass. She threw herself
upon the turf at his horse’s feet; she
lifted her bleeding and tortured hands to his
gaze, and once more poured out her prayer
for the life of her lover; with trembling lips
she told him why Richard still lived&mdash;why the
curfew had not sounded.</p>

<p>Lady Maud looking out of her latticed window
at the castle, saw the great protector
dismount, lift the fainting form in his arms
and bear her to her lover. She saw the guards
release their prisoner, and she heard the
shouts of joy at his deliverance; then she
welcomed the night that shut the scene out
from her envious eye and sculptured her in
its gloom.</p>

<p>At the next matin bell old Jasper died, and
at curfew toll he was laid beside the wife
who had died in his youth, but the memory
of whom had been with him always.</p>

<p>The other night a policeman who was patrolling
High street east, heard a whistle
blown, followed by shouts for “police!” and
after a run of half a block he came to a halt
in front of a house where a second-story window
was raised and a man had half his length
over the sill.</p>

<p>A well-to-do but unsophisticated back-woodsman
was in the city lately, attending
the Fat Stock Show, and brought along his
wife and daughters to see the sights and do
some shopping. Among other places they visited
was Mandel’s new store, and after wandering
around the first floor for a while the
party came to a stop near the elevators.</p>

<p>One of the daughters was first to discover
the cars moving silently up and down, receiving
and discharging their cargoes of passengers.
She jerked her father’s coat sleeve
to direct his attention to the phenomenon,
and in a tone that was audible to the clerks
in the neighborhood asked:</p>

<p>“What’s that, paw&mdash;that thing going up
and down, with sofys in it?”</p>

<p>The old man gave the elevator a long,
calm, deliberate, scrutinizing stare, and exclaimed
with joy:</p>

<p>“By gosh! it’s a telephone! the first I ever
saw!”</p>

<h3><a name="An_Emergency" id="An_Emergency">An Emergency.</a></h3>


<p>A few days ago a man with a weak and
humble expression, and wearing a summer
suit of clothes, applied to one of the railroad
passenger agents for a dead-head pass to
Toledo.</p>

<p>“Why when do you want to go to Toledo?”</p>

<p>“To get married.”</p>

<p>“And you haven’t any money?”</p>

<p>“Not above twenty-five cents.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better be worth your fare to
Toledo before taking a wife on your hands
to support?”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand the case,” protested
the man. “I’m going to marry a widow
worth at least $5,000, and the first thing I
shall do will be to remit you the price of a
ticket. I’m poor, and the widow knows it,
but she marries me for love.”</p>

<p>He protested so long and earnestly that he
was finally passed down the road. Two
days elapsed, and then a letter was received
from him saying:</p>

<p>“Heaven bless you for your kindness?
Reached here all right, and married the widow
according to programme. It turns out
that she isn’t worth a copper. In this emergency
may I ask you to pass us both to Detroit,
where I have hopes of striking a job?”</p>

“I know where you got that information,”

When he can stand on his hind legs
and eat his luxurious way along a clothes-line,
all the circus posters in the world can’t
lure him away from the night shirt and the
par boiled sheet. Be just to the goat. And
how he does love a coil of manilla rope or a
rubber door mat. The fact is, the goat is
gifted with a fine rather epicurean taste, and
if we could afford to feed him the things he
is fond of he would never touch a tomato can.&mdash;<i>Hawkeye.</i></p>

<p class="center"><b>A Work on Winter Gardening, giving the
Results of Actual Practice.</b></p>

<p>The author for several years past has found recreation
in beautifying his study with plants; his work has resulted
in so much enjoyment to himself and his friends
that he has been induced to tell what he did and how he
did it. The book is not a mere dry set of directions, but
its teachings are presented in the pleasant form of letters
to some young ladies, who, having witnessed the author’s
success, have asked his instruction, and this allows a
genial personality to pervade the work, and makes it
withal readable as well as instructive. It is a most excellent
guide to successful winter gardening, as suited
to American homes, with our peculiar domestic surroundings,
and those who follow its teachings will reach
a satisfactory measure of success. The engravings include
several representations of the author’s study.

<p>The most promising field for men of talent and ambition
at the present day is the railroad service. The
pay is large in many instances, while the service is
continuous and honorable. Most of our railroad men
began life on the farm. Of this class is the author of
the accompanying books descriptive of railway operations,
who has been connected continuously with railroads
as a subordinate and officer for 27 years. He was
brought up on a farm, and began railroading as a lad
at $7 per month. He has written a number of standard
books on various topics connected with the organization,
construction, management and policy of railroads.
These books are of interest not only to railroad men
but to the general reader as well. They are indispensable
to the student. They present every phase of railroad
life, and are written in an easy and simple style
that both interests and instructs. The books are as

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
